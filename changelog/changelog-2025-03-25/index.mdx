## ⚡ Better Support for FastAPI Specs

FastAPI has quickly become a favorite among Python developers due to its intuitive design, powerful data validation, and impressive performance. Yet, effectively generating SDKs from FastAPI specifications has often required manual tweaks and workarounds.

Our latest improvements eliminate these hurdles, providing robust, automated integration for FastAPI specs, ensuring greater accuracy and significantly simplifying your workflow.
