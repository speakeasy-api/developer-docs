### New Features

- **React Embeds** - The Speakeasy platform web app is always there if you need it, but if you already have a homegrown platform, you can alternately [add us in as a React embed](/docs/introduction/introduction). Check out the below demo of Alexa, from our engineering team, adding Speakeasy embeds into a web app

import portal_url_1 from "./changelog-august-30-2022-image-01.mp4";

</video>

(plus [bonus footage](https://www.loom.com/share/ce17b0e28c3746b0aaf704460fdf34a8) of Alexa setting up filtering for the embeds)

### Smaller Changes

- **\[Typescript\] Mask sensitive data** - Customers using the typescript SDK can now prevent sensitive fields from entering the platform. [See our docs for how to set up field masking](/docs/introduction/introduction).
- **\[Self Hosting\] Support for BigQuery storage** - Store API logs in your data warehouse. Userâ€™s self-hosting Speakeasy on GCP can now store requests in BigQuery.
