## API Linting

Where does API developer experience start? SDKs are super important, but they're the final step in the integration process. The first step is the API itself and making sure that a consistent interface is being exposed. How do you ensure that your API is consistent, especially as the number of developers contributing grows? With an API linter of course!

Now, linters don't have the greatest reputation in the developer community, but that bad reputation is deserved. Most linters have been a drag on developer productivity. They throw up opaque warnings and unnecessarily block progress on feature development. We saw an opportunity to do better.

We've focused on making sure the Speakeasy linter will speed up development, rather than slows it down. Here's how our linter is different:

- It runs where your work happens:
  - Speakeasy CLI
  - VS Code extension
  - CI/CD pipelines
- The output is human-readable and clearly actionable
- It comes with our robust default ruleset that can be easily customized with spectral rules to match your org's API style guide.

To get started just update to the latest version of the Speakeasy CLI and run `speakeasy lint`.

## Postman Collection Generation [Alpha]

Ready your curl requests, because Speakeasy is now able to generate high quality Postman Collections from your OpenAPI document.

Postman Collections facilitate the easy adoption, development, and testing of your APIs. They allow users to understand the API's capabilities quickly through executing API requests without the need to set up a coding environment.

As with any API artifact, a collection is only as useful as it is up-to-date. Speakeasy's Postman Collection generation is designed to be a seamless part of your API development workflow.

Collection generation is free while it's in alpha, so give it a try and let us know what you think!
