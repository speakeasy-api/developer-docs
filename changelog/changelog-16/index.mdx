Updating an API is a harrowing task. There’s plentiful opportunity to introduce issues that could lead to unintended functionality in your product. So why make it even harder on yourself by then hand rolling the changes out to all of your client libraries in a variety of languages? At that point, you’re just asking for there to be inconsistencies between SDKs that require painful client migrations to address in the future.

That’s why Speakeasy is making it easy with automatic generation & versioning of your API’s SDKs. All you need to do is review and approve.

### **New Features**

**PRs for New Versions** - Speakeasy provides both a github workflow & action to automate SDK creation. When a new version of your OpenAPI spec is published, we’ll create new commits on a PR branch with the changes for each SDK and then an associated Github release upon merge. We can even automate publishing to package managers.

import portal_url_1 from "./gh-workflow.mp4";
