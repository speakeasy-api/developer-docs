Speakeasy is introducing two powerful updates to enhance your API workflows:

✨ **Automated Code Sample URLs** 
<br />We now provide you with a single, stable URL that automatically displays up-to-date SDK code examples. Simply paste this URL into your documentation platform once, and we'll ensure your code samples stay synchronized with your latest API changes.

🔄 **Overlay Management in Speakeasy Studio** 
<br />You can now edit your OpenAPI specifications directly within Speakeasy Studio, with every change automatically preserved as an overlay. This means you can freely modify your specs in a familiar environment while keeping your source files unchanged.


## Automated Code Sample URLs

Automated Code Sample URLs give you a stable, auto-updating link for SDK code samples. All you have to do is drop that link into your docs platform, and your code examples will stay in sync with your API. Behind the scenes, we dynamically generate SDK-specific code snippets using the x-codeSamples extension in your OpenAPI spec, ensuring your documentation always shows the latest, most accurate examples for your developers.

#### What’s New?

- **Automated SDK Code Samples:** Generate and apply SDK usage examples to your OpenAPI specs effortlessly.
- **Seamless Integration:** Supported by popular documentation platforms, including Scalar, Bump.sh, Mintlify, Redocly and ReadMe.
- **Always Up-to-Date:** Automatically syncs with your latest SDK updates, ensuring accurate and consistent code snippets.

#### How It Works

Speakeasy tracks your base OpenAPI document and overlays containing SDK code samples. When you generate an SDK via GitHub Actions and merge the changes to the main branch, Speakeasy automatically creates a Combined Spec that includes all OpenAPI operations along with the generated `x-codeSamples` extensions. These overlays ensure your API documentation includes accurate, language-specific examples tailored to each operation ID.

## Overlay Management in Speakeasy Studio

We've made managing OpenAPI specs in Speakeasy Studio simpler and more intuitive. Now you can edit your API specs directly in the Studio, and your changes are automatically saved as overlays—no manual overlay creation needed. This means you can modify your specs without affecting the source, all while staying in the Studio. 

Here's a quick look at how it works:

import code_sample_urls from "./assets/code-sample-urls.mp4";

<div className="mt-10">
  <video controls={false} loop={true} autoPlay={true} width="100%">
    <source src={code_sample_urls} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

### Why This Matters

- **Edit without worry:** Make changes directly to your specs and they're automatically saved as overlays
- **Stay focused:** Manage all your API modifications in one place
- **Learn overlays:** Get greater visibility into overlay functionality while making edits.
- **Automatic SDK regeneration:** SDKs are regenerated with each save, ensuring your changes are always reflected.
