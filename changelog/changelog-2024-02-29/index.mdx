import quickstart_url from './cli-quickstart.mp4';

Following on from our TypeScript work in January, we've kept our focus on upleveling our developer experience of both our platform and our generation targets. This month our CLI got an overhaul, and Terraform got a package of upgrades. The result is an experience that is more intuitive, more powerful, and more flexible for both our users and their end users.

Let's jump into it 🚀

## Terraform v2

Terraform is the go to tool for businesses implementing a strict disaster recovery plan.  For any SaaS businesses trying to sell API usage to these enterprises, that makes offering a Terraform Provider a must-have. 

Our Terraform generation has made maintaining a provider trivially easy and unlocked our customers ability to win large enterprise contracts. We've been working hard to extend that opportunity to every API. That's why we're excited to announce the release of Terraform v2 with a range of new features to support increasingly complex APIs:

- Collapse multiple API endpoints into a single Terraform Entity.
- Add Custom Plan Validators to your Provider
- Automatically enforced Runtime Validations
- Support for `default` and `const` attributes
- Handling of Batch Endpoints

For the details, please read the full release notes [here](/post/release-terraform-v2).

## Upgraded CLI - Enhanced Quickstart

We received a lot of feedback from our users about the CLI being their preferred interface for generating SDKs. We've therefore invested in creating what we think is one of the best CLI experiences available anywhere today. The principles that guided our rebuild were:

- ✨ No magic incantations required
- 😀 Flattened command hierarchy
- 👩‍🔧 Design for humans

Tangibly it means you don't need any context or docs to use the CLI. Our interactive prompts will make setting up your SDKs a breeze.
