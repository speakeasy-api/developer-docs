## 2024, a year in review 📅

As we wrap up 2024, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the year. It's been a year of growth, learning and building. We've launched some exciting new features, 
expanded our team and continued to push the boundaries of what's possible with code generation.

Here are some of the highlights from 2024:

- We continued the march towards our vision of "generating handwritten SDKs" for REST APIs. Our TypeScript generation led the charge adding [functional support](/post/standalone-functions), [react hooks](/release-react-hooks) and [webhooks](/post/release-webhooks-support). Other languages followed with [PHP adding support for Laravel](/post/release-php) and Python with [async functions and Pydantic2.0 type-safety](/post/release-python-v2-alpha).
- We launched our [API contract testing](/post/release-contract-testing/) feature to help you automate your API testing leveraging the completeness of SDKs.
- We brought on several new team members across engineering, support and GTM. This team is on 🔥.
- We raised a [Series A](/post/fundraising-series-a/) to fuel our growth and expand our product offerings!

## 2025, what's coming up? 🚀

As I look ahead to 2025 the API landscape is rapidly evolving for consumers with AI agents and LLMs changing how we manage and execute API calls. I'm absolutely thrilled for 
what we're cooking behind the scenes. Here's a sneak peek at what's coming up in 2025:

- An exciting new way to design your SDKs ! 🎨
- Expanding on [our initial foray into API testing]() with more Arazzo support, multi endpoint testing and a new testing experience. 
- Support for more non-HTTP protocols: webhooks, events and internal API landscapes
- Make it really easy for LLMs to discover and connect with your APIs. All your AI tools, generated.
- Leverage the power of executable code samples through prompts. No more 3 pane doc sites.

Simply put, the job's not finished ! 🚧
