The release of our C# SDK marks an important milestone for Speakeasy. Over half of the languages we support are now in GA! As always, a massive thank you to all our customers and users for their feedback and support. We couldn't have done it without you 🎉 And it goes without saying, we won't stop here. More to come very shortly!

## C# General Availability

Microsoft acolytes and fintech employees rejoice! We're excited to announce that C# is now generally available. General availability means that the public interface is now stable, and every feature of Speakeasy's generation platform is accessible. A few of the highlights that have us excited include:

- Configurable support for `.NET 5.X` and above
- `Async`/`Await` support
- OAuth2.0 support
- Support for complex number types:
  - `System.Numbers.BigInteger`
  - `System.Decimal`
- Strong-typing with IntelliSense support

The full details can be found [here](/docs/sdk-design/csharp/methodology-csharp)

## Speakeasy Ask

We're excited to announce the release of [Speakeasy Ask](/docs/speakeasy-cli/ask), our AI-enhanced CLI. Speakeasy Ask is a new feature that allows you to ask questions about your OpenAPI spec and SDKs without leaving our CLI. This feature is designed to make it easy to access the Speakeasy knowledge base wherever your work happens. 

No more side by side windows or switching between tabs. Just ask your question and get the answer you need.
