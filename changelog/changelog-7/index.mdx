## New Features

- **API Usage Dashboards \[Embed\]** \- Make it easy for your developers and API users to understand API errors and traffic patterns with our out-of-the-box usage dashboards. With a click or two, users can see data across various time spans, and group by API endpoints, customer, and status code. The dashboards are of course available as an embed that can be incorporated into your own developer portal or any customer facing app. [Watch Chase walkthrough the new embed!](https://www.loom.com/share/637bbadcbdba499e949a4ec86ca39246)
