## New Features

- **EasyShares** - Building a robust developer portal takes time. Donâ€™t wait months to get the benefits. Install the Speakeasy SDK, and auto-generate your client-specific dev portal in minutes. Make it easy for your API users to troubleshoot errors, and save your developers time that would otherwise be spent on zoom meetings. With a couple clicks you have a unique site that can be shared with your customer, with full control over the data. Set the site to expire after an hour, a day, a week, however long it takes your customer to finish the task at hand!

## Incremental Improvements & Fixes

- **\[Bug Fix\] Scaled Schema Differ** - Those with large APIs no longer need worry! The OpenAPI schema differ now works with obscenely large OpenAPI schemas, so you can see changes to your API no matter its size.
- \[**Improvement**\] **Auto-reload on filter changes** - The usage Dashboards now auto-refresh when you change your filters.
