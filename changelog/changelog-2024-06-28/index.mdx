import publishing_video from './assets/on-demand-publishing.mp4';
import YouTube from 'react-youtube';

You've just generated your SDK, and you're feeling good, but in the immortal words of Kobe Bryant, "Jobs not finished. SDK published? I don't think so." 

<div className="mt-10 flex justify-center items-center" >
  <YouTube
    videoId="fY7l2pcxdHM"
  />
</div>

Until it's published, your SDK is NOT done. Fortunately, with our recent release it's easier than ever to not only generate, but also publish your SDKs "On Demand". 

## Pre-Releases & On-Demand Publishing

<div className='mt-10'>
  <video controls={false} loop={true} autoPlay={true} width="100%" >
    <source src={publishing_video} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

You can now add any pre-release version identifiers that you want to tag your SDK with: `-alpha`, `-beta`, etc. As you update your SDK, we'll automatically version bump while retaining the pre-release tags. Then when you're ready, you can remove the tag and publish your new version.

And now, all this can be done from the Speakeasy dashboard, just head to the publishing tab and re-publish your SDKs whenever you want.
