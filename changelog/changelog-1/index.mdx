### New Features

- **Know when your API drifts from your docs** - The Speakeasy SDK now checks API traffic against your uploaded OpenAPI schema. When traffic that is not present in your schema is served by your API, your team will be able to diff schemas and see where drift has occurred.

import portal_url_1 from "./changelog-august-17-2022-image-01.mp4";

  loop={true}
  autoPlay={true}
  muted={true}
  width="100%"
  alt="The Speakeasy SDK now checks API traffic against your uploaded OpenAPI schema"
>
  <source src={portal_url_1} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

- **Push Alerts to the whole team** \- To enable automation, Speakeasy pushes an event to your webhook for each unknown endpoint when drift is detected. Integrate your team's tooling with our webhooks to create automatic Slack alerts so you know as soon as something changes!

import portal_url_2 from "./changelog-august-17-2022-image-02.mp4";

{" "}

<video
  controls={false}
  loop={true}
  autoPlay={true}
  muted={true}
  width="100%"
  alt="Speakeasy pushes an event to your webhook"
>
  <source src={portal_url_2} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

### Smaller Improvements

- Speakeasy is now available for APIs written in **typescript**, thanks to our typescript SDK!
