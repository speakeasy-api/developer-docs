[Laravel raised $57M in Series A funding](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-raises-57-million-series-a) 💰 making it clear that PHP is back in a big way. That makes it the perfect time to announce the beta release of our new PHP SDK Generator! We're bringing modern type safety and a streamlined developer experience to PHP SDKs generated on our platform.

And in less splashy (but still important) news, we're launching Single Sign-On (SSO) support on the Speakeasy platform!

Read on for more details.

## Type-Safe PHP Generation is now in Beta

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Components;
use Dub\Models\Operations;

$security = new Components\Security(
    token: "DUB_API_KEY",
);

$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity($security)->build();

try {
    $request = new Operations\CreateLinkRequestBody(
        url: 'https://google.com',
        tagIds: '...',
        externalId: '123456',
    );
    $response = $sdk->links->create($request);

    if ($response->linkSchema !== null) {
        // handle response
    }
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    // handle exception
}
```

Here's a quick rundown of what our new PHP SDK Generator brings to the table:

- **Robust type safety** with carefully typed properties for all models
- **Support for union types**, embracing PHP 8's modern type system
- **Readability**, a streamlined, object-oriented approach for easy debugging
- **Minimal external dependencies** for a lightweight footprint
- **IDE compatibility** for a superior development experience

We can't wait to hear what people think! Please don't hesitate to reach out with feedback and questions.

## SSO for Enterprises

![SSO](./assets/sso.png)

We're excited to announce the launch of Single Sign-On (SSO) support on the Speakeasy platform. Our SSO is compatible with any IDP that uses SAML or OIDC (i.e. Okta).

We're committed to providing robust, enterprise-grade solutions to businesses of every size.

If you're interested in enabling SSO for your organization, please reach out to your account manager for access.
