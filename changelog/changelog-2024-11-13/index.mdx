import { Callout } from "~/components";

Ever wished managing SDK versions was as simple as adding a label? Or wanted your OpenAPI transformations to just work™️ every time you regenerate? We've got you covered with some powerful new features that will make iterating on your SDK a breeze.

## GitHub-Native Version Management

import label_versioning from "./assets/label-versioning.mp4";

<div className="mt-10">
  <video controls={false} loop={true} autoPlay={true} width="100%">
    <source src={label_versioning} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

Managing SDK versions should be as natural as any other GitHub workflow. Now it is! With label-based versioning, you can control your SDK's version bumps right from your pull request:

- **Automated Version Detection**: By default, we'll analyze your changes and suggest the appropriate semantic version bump. You'll see our suggested version label on your generated PR.
- **Manual Override**: Want to override our suggestion? Just remove the current label and add a `major`, `minor`, or `patch` label to your PR.
- **Persistent Preferences**: Your chosen version bump persists across regenerations until you change it.
- **Pre-release Support**: Planning a beta release? When you are ready to move off your pre-release, simply add the label `graduate`.

This feature is automatically active in all SDK generation workflows today. If you would also like generation to kick off immediately after adding a label, just add the following to your GitHub workflow file:

```yaml
# !focus(7,21:22)
name: Generate
permissions:
    checks: write
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
    statuses: write
"on":
    workflow_dispatch:
        inputs:
            force:
                description: Force generation of SDKs
                type: boolean
                default: false
            push_code_samples_only:
                description: Force push only code samples from SDK generation
                type: boolean
                default: false
            set_version:
                description: optionally set a specific SDK version
                type: string
    pull_request:
        types: [labeled]
    schedule:
        - cron: 0 0 * * *
```

## OpenAPI Transformations

```yaml workflow.yaml
# !focus(7:12)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
    transformations:
      - removeUnused: true
      - filterOperations:
          operations: getPets, createPet
          include: true # exclude: true
      - cleanup: true
```

OpenAPI transformations are now a first-class citizen in your generation workflow. Instead of manually running transforms or building custom pipelines, transformations are automatically applied every time your SDK is generated.

Available transforms:
- **`filterOperations`**: Include or exclude specific operations from your SDK
- **`removeUnused`**: Automatically clean up unused schemas and components
- **`cleanup`**: Fix and standardize your OpenAPI spec's formatting

The best part? Transformations adapt to your spec changes. For example, if you're filtering to include specific operations, newly added operations matching your filter will automatically flow through to your SDK.

## Overlay Summaries

import overlay_output from "./assets/overlay-output.mp4";

<div className="mt-10">
  <video controls={false} loop={true} autoPlay={true} width="100%">
    <source src={overlay_output} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

When applying OpenAPI overlays, it's crucial to understand exactly how they're modifying your spec. Our new overlay summaries provide clear, actionable insights into the changes.

These summaries help you:
- Quickly validate your overlay changes,
- Understand the impact on your API spec,
- Debug overlay application issues.
