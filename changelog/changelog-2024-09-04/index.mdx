What's better than an ergonomic, type-safe TypeScript SDK? A **lean**, ergonomic, type-safe TypeScript SDK that's optimized for the browser! We've made some major improvements to our TypeScript generation so that you can better serve your users who are building web applications.

And best of all, no breaking changes are required on your end. Just rerun your TypeScript generation and get the latest and greatest 🎉

## Lean TypeScript SDKs with standalone functions

When SDKs are large, they can bloat the bundle size of your user's app, even if they're only using a small portion of your SDK's functionality. That matters because the smaller the bundle, the faster the app loads, the better the user experience. If your SDK is too large, it may be a non-starter for your users.

To address this, we've introduced a new feature for TypeScript SDKs called **Standalone Functions** to make your SDKs tree-shakable. That will allow your users to import only the functions they need, resulting in a smaller bundle size and a more performant application.

Here's an example of standalone functions in action via [Dub's SDK](https://github.com/dubinc/dub-ts):

<CodeWithTabs>

```typescript !!tabs function_based.ts
import { DubCore } from "dub/core.js";
import { linksCount } from "dub/funcs/linksCount.js";

async function run() {
  const dub = new DubCore();

  const result = await linksCount(dub);
  if (!result.ok) {
    throw result.error;
  }

  // Use the result
  console.log("Link count:", result.value);
}

run();
```

```typescript !!tabs class_based.ts
import { Dub } from "dub";

async function run() {
  const dub = new Dub();

  const count = await dub.links.count();

  console.log("Link count:", count);
}

run();
```

</CodeWithTabs>

The performance benefits are enormous. In a benchmark test using a single function from the Dub SDK, bundle-size reduced from **324.4 kb -> 82.1 kb**. That's a **75% reduction** in bundle size!

## Regenerate Github SDKs from the CLI

![Speakeasy run github](./assets/github-run-cli.png)

You can now remotely generate your SDKs on GitHub directly from your terminal! Just use the `​--github`​ flag with `​speakeasy run​` to kick off a remote generation.

If you haven’t installed the GitHub app yet, don’t worry. Follow the prompts in your workspace to complete the setup. This will ensure the Speakeasy Github app has access to your managed repositories within your organization.

Ready to streamline your workflow? Give it a try!
