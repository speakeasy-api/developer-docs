Even though we are a team of lovely people, we understand that not everyone wants to talk to us to get their SDK creation pipeline set up. That’s why we’re hard at work building a self-serve pipeline. With just a few simple clicks in our platform UI, production-ready SDKs will magically appear in your Github. If you want to see the final result, check out this [Python SDK repo](https://github.com/speakeasy-sdks/openai-python-sdk) for OpenAI API, and its [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/speakeasy-openai/).

We’re currently running user feedback sessions, so if you’re interested in getting your hands on this new feature ASAP, [sign up for a testing slot](https://calendly.com/d/yy2-6r6-3d4/alpha-test-latest-speakeasy-release) before they fill up!

## New Features

**Self-serve SDK Creation Pipeline:** You can now go from spec to published package in a couple clicks. Our pipeline runs as part of your CI/CD, so you’ll never need to worry about SDKs getting out of sync with your spec again. To get started, all you need to do is:

1. Upload your OpenAPI spec.
2. Select your target languages.
3. Optionally add publishing information.
4. Click ‘Create’ — thats it !

Check it out in action below:

import portal_url_1 from "./sdk-pipeline.mp4";

</video>

## Improvements

**Publishing for Java**: You can now publish your Java SDKs to Maven. Just add your Maven API key and start publishing!

**Test coverage for SDKs**: SDKs are a critical product surface area, and we treat them as such. We’ve revamped our test coverage and developed a set of language specific test suites to prevent any regressions in the SDKs we create.
