## 📝 Speakeasy Studio: Navigate OpenAPI Specs with Ease
Speakeasy Studio now provides a structured, interactive outline for OpenAPI specs and SDK README files, significantly improving the navigation and editing experience.

## 📌 API Registry: Smarter Tracking, Seamless Organization  
We've redesigned the API Registry to make it even more powerful: from tracking changes at-a-glance, to sharing any API revision with a click.

🏗️ **DeepObject Query Parameter Support for Terraform Providers**  
Terraform provider generation now supports `style: deepObject`. This improves usability and reduces complexity for consumers by allowing them to define structured attributes in Terraform configurations, instead of needing to manually construct key-value query strings.

OpenAPI specs are powerful but often overwhelming—long, complex, and difficult to navigate. Finding key details like authentication methods, endpoints, or dependencies can be time-consuming and frustrating.  

### What’s New?  
Speakeasy Studio now provides a structured, interactive outline for OpenAPI specs and SDK README files, making it effortless to:  \
✅ **Jump to key sections** like servers, security settings, and endpoints.  
✅ **Quickly locate dependencies** without endless scrolling.  
✅ **Improve accuracy** by reducing the risk of missing critical spec details.  

This update eliminates the pain of manually searching through massive API definitions. Everything you need is now neatly organized and just a click away.

The API Registry page is the central hub for tracking OpenAPI document revisions, SDK dependencies, and API history—all in one place.

### **What’s New?**  
We've redesigned the API Registry to make it even more powerful:  \
✅ **Improved artifact grouping** for better organization and clarity.  
✅ **More structured spec representation**, making it easier to track changes at a glance.  
✅ **One-click API sharing**, allowing any revision to be turned into a public URL instantly.  
✅ **Namespace archiving**, helping teams manage deprecated or inactive APIs effortlessly.  

Whether you're maintaining API history, sharing specs, or tracking dependencies, the new API Registry page makes API management more intuitive and efficient.

## 🏗️ DeepObject Query Parameter Support for Terraform Providers

Some APIs accept structured objects as query parameters. For example, an API might support filtering on multiple fields (`status` and `type`):
```
GET /users?filter[status]=active&filter[type]=premium
```

### Before DeepObject Support
Without `deepObject` support, consumers of a Terraform provider for this API would need to construct query strings manually. This means defining query parameters as flat key-value pairs or concatenating them into a string:

```hcl
data "example_resource" "query" {
  query = "filter[status]=active&filter[type]=premium"
}
```

This approach is unintuitive, error prone, and hard to maintain.

### With DeepObject Support

Now, Speakeasy supports `style: deepObject` in OpenAPI specifications. For example:

```yaml
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: filter
          in: query
          style: deepObject
          explode: true
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              status:
                type: string
              type:
                type: string
```

With `deepObject` support, Terraform provider consumers can now define query parameters as structured attributes — eliminating the need to construct manual query strings:

```hcl
data "example_resource" "query" {
  parameters = {
    status = "active"
    type   = "premium"
  }
}
```

### Key Benefits
This has a significant impact on consumer ergonomics:
✅ Eliminates manual query string construction\
✅ Supports complex filtering and nested input\
✅ Ensures Terraform provider behavior matches API expectations
