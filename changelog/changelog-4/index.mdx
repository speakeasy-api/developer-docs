## New Features

- **Request Replay** - It can be difficult to reproduce API issues that users are seeing in production: thereâ€™s so many variables that need to be accounted for. Now you can use the request viewer to find and replay the exact request you need. All the headers and request objects are editable so that you can make sure you have a high fidelity replica to test with.

## Smaller Changes

- **OpenAPI Schema Validation - Catch errors in your OpenAPI schema before your clients do. If you upload an OpenAPI spec, Speakeasy will run a validation before applying it to your managed APIs. It will inform you of any errors in the spec, so you can address them.**
- **\[self-hosting\] Ambassador Support** - Speakeasy self-hosting now supports clients using Ambassador. Just configure the values.yaml file to get set up.
