# Switching default package manager to `pnpm`

## Prerequisite

- A GitHub repository with the Speakeasy [SDK Generation GitHub Action](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action) integrated and enabled.

## Adding `pnpm` Support

1. Open the GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/sdk-generation.yaml`).
2. Modify the `generate` job to include the `pnpm_version` input. This ensures pnpm is installed during the action.

### Example Workflow File

```yaml
name: Generate
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
      set_version:
        description: Optionally set a specific SDK version
        type: string
jobs:
  generate:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/workflow-executor.yaml@v15
    with:
      force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
      mode: pr
      set_version: ${{ github.event.inputs.set_version }}
      speakeasy_version: latest
      working_directory: packages/sdk
      pnpm_version: "9.19.4" # Specify the required pnpm version
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      npm_token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN_ELEVATED }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

## (Optional) Verifying `pnpm` Installation

Ensure pnpm is used in the workflow by adding a step to verify its presence:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Verify pnpm installation
    run: pnpm --version
```

This outputs the installed `pnpm` version for confirmation during workflow execution.

## Additional Notes

- Use the same `pnpm_version` as used in local development for consistency.
- Ensure any `package.json` files are compatible with pnpm. Run `pnpm install` locally to verify.

## Using PNPM in Monorepos

When working with monorepos, pnpm offers several advantages including strict module resolution and efficient workspace management. To configure Speakeasy to use pnpm in your monorepo:

### Local Development Configuration

Add the `compileCommand` configuration to your `gen.yaml` file:

```yaml
typescript:
  compileCommand:
    - pnpm
    - install
```

### Workspace Configuration

Ensure your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` includes the SDK directory:

```yaml
packages:
  - "packages/*"
  - "sdk/*" # Include your SDK location
```

### Benefits for Monorepos

- **Strict module resolution**: Prevents dependency confusion between packages
- **Efficient storage**: Shared dependencies across workspace packages
- **Better workspace support**: Built-in monorepo tooling
