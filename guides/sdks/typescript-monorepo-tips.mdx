# Tips for Integrating a TypeScript SDK into a Monorepo

<Callout title="Get Started" >
If you're looking to set up a monorepo from scratch, check out our [Create a monorepo](/guides/sdks/creating-a-monorepo) guide first.

## Dependency Confusion

The most common issue we see is dependency confusion. This happens when a developer have multiple versions of the same dependency across different packages in the monorepo.

### Why is this a problem?

Let's say a developer have Zod installed in their monorepo's root, and their Speakeasy SDK also uses Zod. They might run into a situation where code like this doesn't work:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await sdk.products.create({
    name: "Cool Product",
    price: "not a number" // This should fail validation
  });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ZodError) { // 🚨 This check fails!
    console.log("Validation error:", err.errors);
  }
}
```

The `instanceof` check fails because they're importing `ZodError` from a different instance of Zod than what the SDK is using. It's the same code, but JavaScript treats them as different classes.

### How to fix it

PNPM's strict module resolution is fantastic at preventing this issue:

```bash
# In .npmrc
shamefully-hoist=false
strict-peer-dependencies=true
```

If you're using Yarn or npm, you'll need to be more explicit:

```json
// With Yarn (in package.json)
{
  "resolutions": {
    "zod": "^3.22.4",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^4.29.5"
  }
}

// With npm (in package.json)
{
  "overrides": {
    "zod": "^3.22.4",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^4.29.5"
  }
}
```

This forces all packages to use the same version of these dependencies, preventing the confusion.

## Module format mismatches - ESM vs CommonJS chaos

The second most common issue is dealing with mixed module formats. Some packages use CommonJS, others use ESM, and a monorepo probably has a mix of both.

### Why this is a problem

You might see errors like:

```
Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module not supported
```

Or:

```
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

These happen when module systems don't align. It's especially common when there's a package using CommonJS trying to import an ESM module, or vice versa.

### How to fix it

The simplest solution is to configure your Speakeasy SDK to use ESM format:

```yaml
# In gen.yaml
typescript:
  moduleFormat: esm
```

If you need to support both ESM and CommonJS packages importing your SDK, you can use the dual format (which is the Speakeasy default):

```yaml
# In gen.yaml
typescript:
  moduleFormat: dual
```

When using `moduleFormat: dual`, make sure the tsconfig.json is set up correctly:

```json
// In tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "module": "esnext",
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

There's a small bundle size tradeoff with dual format, but it's usually worth it for the compatibility benefits.

## Package manager differences - npm vs the world

The last common issue is package manager compatibility. Speakeasy uses npm when building SDKs, but a monorepo might use pnpm, Yarn, or even Bun.

### Why this is a problem

Different package managers handle dependencies differently. This can lead to subtle issues where the SDK works fine when generated, but breaks when integrated into the monorepo.

For example, one might see errors about missing dependencies that they know are installed, or weird resolution issues that only happen in the monorepo.

### How to fix it

Fortunately, this one's easy to solve. Just customize the compile command in your `gen.yaml`:

```yaml
# For pnpm
typescript:
  compileCommand:
    - pnpm
    - install
```

This tells Speakeasy to use the preferred package manager when building the SDK.

## Putting it all together - a real-world example

This is an example of how a developer may set up a monorepo with a Speakeasy SDK:

```
my-monorepo/
├── package.json
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── tsconfig.json
├── packages/
│   ├── api-sdk/         # Speakeasy-generated SDK
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json
│   │   └── gen.yaml
│   ├── frontend/        # Frontend application using the SDK
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   └── backend/         # Backend service using the SDK
│       ├── package.json
│       └── tsconfig.json
```

pnpm-workspace.yaml:
```yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
```

frontend/package.json:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "api-sdk": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

gen.yaml:
```yaml
typescript:
  moduleFormat: esm
  compileCommand:
    - pnpm
    - install
    - and
    - pnpm
    - build
```

This setup gives:
1. A consistent dependency tree with pnpm's strict module resolution
2. ESM modules for maximum compatibility
3. pnpm for package management

## Best practices for TypeScript SDKs in monorepos

Beyond the specific issues above, here are some general best practices:

- **Use workspace references**: Always reference your SDK using workspace syntax (`workspace:*`) rather than local file paths
- **Consistent TypeScript versions**: Use the same TypeScript version across all packages
- **Shared tsconfig**: Create a base tsconfig.json that all packages extend
- **Centralized types**: Consider creating a shared types package for common interfaces
- **Integration tests**: Write tests that verify the SDK works correctly with other packages
