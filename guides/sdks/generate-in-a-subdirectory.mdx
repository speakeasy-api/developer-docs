# Generate SDK in a Subdirectory

Similar to setting up a monorepo, you can also configure Speakeasy to generate your SDK into a subdirectory. This setup maybe useful in maintaining seperation between handwritten and generated code or for consuming the SDK in a monolithic codebase.

## Step 1: 

In the root of your existing directory run `speakeasy quickstart`:

## Step 2: 

Select your generation language.

## Step 3: 

Name your package.

## Step 4: 

If you're setting your SDK up in a folder with existing subfolders, you will be prompted to select an output directory.

## Step 5: 

Complete generating your SDK.

Going forward to generate your SDK navigate to your SDK folder and run `speakeasy run`.
