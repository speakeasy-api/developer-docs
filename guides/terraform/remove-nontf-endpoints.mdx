# Overlay to remove non-Terraform endpoints

Often generating a Terraform provider from your OpenAPI spec means using a subset of endpoints to generate the provider. Endpoints or `paths` in your spec not used for terraform
generation will still be used to generate a Go client inside your provider. This can lead to a bloated provider with unused endpoints. If you want to remove these consider using
the following overlay.

```yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Overlay openapi.yaml
  version: 0.1.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths.*.*[?(!@.x-speakeasy-entity-operation && @.operationId)] # Find all paths that do not have x-speakeasy-entity-operation and operationId
    remove: true
```
When applied to an OpenAPI specification this overlay will remove any paths from the specification that are not tagged with `x-speakeasy-entity-operation`. The operation needed to
map an OpenAPI `operationId` to a terraform resource.

To apply this overlay run `speakeasy overlay apply -s {your-spec.yaml} -o {overlay.yaml}`. This will generate a new OpenAPI specification with the paths removed.

Finally add this to your terraform generation workflow by using `speakeasy configure sources` to add an overlay to any source with an existing openapi specificaiton configured.
