Working on a remote-first dev team can be challenging. Most of us devs have spent years building up processes optimized for in person collaboration. We've found a really quick win has been posting short [Loom](https://www.linkedin.com/company/useloom/) videos for dev updates in our slack! This builds shared context for our team without more meetings. Our hope is to build up dozens of these so new hires can have a library of resources to watch and reference when they join the team. In this short clip, I demonstrate how we use [Pulumi](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pulumi/) for managing infra.
