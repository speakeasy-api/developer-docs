Great documentation isn't just a nice-to-have — it's essential for developer adoption and success. We've heard from countless companies that while generating SDKs solved a crucial part of their API distribution challenge, they're still struggling to provide a documentation experience that matches their brand and meets their developers' needs.

We're excited to announce the launch of Speakeasy Docs, powered by [Scalar](https://scalar.com/). This new offering combines Speakeasy's expertise in SDK generation with Scalar's best-in-class documentation platform to provide a complete solution so companies can deliver exceptional developer experiences.

## Too often docs let developers down

Companies often face a difficult choice when building and maintaining API documentation: invest significant engineering resources into building the docs experience they want, or protect engineering resources by settling for a generic experience that doesn't meet their quality bar.

Existing documentation solutions have problems such as customization limitations, OpenAPI spec rendering challenges, and difficulties maintaining consistency between their SDKs and documentation. These limitations put a ceiling on the developer experience they can deliver, impacting adoption and satisfaction.

## The docs your API deserves

**Complete OpenAPI support**: Your API is more complicated than the pet store API. That's why Speakeasy Docs starts with industry-leading OpenAPI spec rendering. Your entire API, in all its messy glory, will be presented with accuracy and clarity in the generated documentation.

**Customized branding**: Companies work hard to establish a unique identity, and your docs should reflect that. Customization is at the heart of Speakeasy Docs. You have complete control over the look and feel of your documentation. Your docs won't just contain your logo — they'll embody your brand's identity, matching your color schemes, typography, and custom design elements seamlessly.

The result? Documentation that looks and feels custom-built for your brand.

**Always in-sync**: We've also solved one of the most persistent challenges in API documentation: maintaining consistency between your SDKs and your docs. By integrating directly with our SDK generation platform, Speakeasy Docs ensures that your documentation and code samples are always in sync. When your API evolves, both your SDKs and documentation update automatically, eliminating the drift that often occurs between documentation and implementation.

## Why we partnered with Scalar

Our partnership with Scalar is built on complementary strengths. While we've focused on building the best SDK generation platform, Scalar has established itself as a leader in API documentation, particularly when it comes to API reference rendering.

This partnership allows both companies to focus on their core strengths:

- Speakeasy: Advanced SDK generation and API tooling
- Scalar: Design excellence and documentation expertise

The result is a solution that's greater than the sum of its parts, offering our customers the best of both worlds without compromise.

### How the partnership works

When you use Speakeasy Docs, you get the full Scalar solution without any limitations. You'll work with one vendor (us), with one support channel for both your docs & SDKs. Down the road, you'll see even deeper integration with new features that make the experience more seamless.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Docs is straightforward and can be done entirely through our self-service dashboard. The platform works seamlessly with your existing OpenAPI specifications, and our team is here to help with any customization needs.

For existing Speakeasy customers, just head to the Docs tab in the Speakeasy dashboard and follow the steps to enable it. For new customers, you can now get started with both SDK generation and documentation in one integrated solution by [signing up](https://app.speakeasy.com/).
