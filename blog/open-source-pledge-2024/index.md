For as long as Speakeasy has had money in a bank account, we've been contributing to open-source projects we depend on. It therefore feels like a natural evolution to announce that we've joined [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) to formalize our support of the maintainers and projects that make our work possible.

## What is the Open Source Pledge?

For too long Open Source software has been taken for granted by the software industry. The Open Source Software Pledge, initiated by Sentry, is attempting to change that by encouraging companies to commit to financially support open-source maintainers. The minimum participation is $2,000 per full-time employed developer per year. You can read more about it [here](https://opensourcepledge.com/about/).

## Speakeasy's open source contributions

We donate a total of $3,523 per month ($42,276 per year) to OSS projects which annualizes to $4,228/engineer.

## Why we support open source

Like any software company in 2024, our success stands on the shoulders of open-source giants. Many of the projects we sponsor have been crucial in developing our product, while others play a vital role in maintaining a healthy API development ecosystem.

## Thank you, OSS community

To all the maintainers, contributors, and issue raisers behind these open-source projects: thank you. Your dedication and hard work have not only made our work possible but have also paved the way for countless other developers and companies to innovate and succeed.

We hope others will join us in supporting open-source software to create a sustainable future for the tools and technologies that power innovation.
