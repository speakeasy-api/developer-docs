**[John Kodumal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kodumal/)** is the co-founder and former CTO of **[LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/)**. At LaunchDarkly, he created the feature flagging category and scaled the business to over 5000 customers. On the first episode of Request // Response, he joined us to discuss:
- The power of separating deployment from release
- How LD pioneered the use of server-sent events, long before it became the tech of choice for LLMs.
- The importance of traversability in API design.
- How the expectations for API design have evolved over time.
- What defines a great Developer Experience.

### More John Kodumal Quotes From The Discussion

1. **Feature Flags Are Powerful**

  "A lot of people look at just that idea of feature flags, and they think that it's small, and they're shocked that there's a multi billion dollar company that does feature flags. But it's not about feature flags. It's about all the changes to the software development lifecycle that feature flags enable"

2. **Traversability Over Endpoints**

  "Nothing should be an endpoint. Everything should be traversable. If you have an endpoint, it's broken."

3. **Working With The Complexity of Developer Needs**

  "In order to fit into someone's SDLC you have to respect the differences that make their software development practices unique---you have to work with them, not force a one-size-fits-all solution."
