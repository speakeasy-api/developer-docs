## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- Both MCP servers set up:
  - [Slack MCP setup guide](/mcp/using-mcp/mcp-server-providers/slack)
  - [Postiz MCP setup guide](/mcp/using-mcp/use-cases/social-media-postiz)

## Installing the MCP servers

After following both setup guides, your `claude_desktop_config.json` should include the Slack MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "SlackMCPServer": {
      "command": "PATH_TO_MCP_SERVER/slack-mcp-server",
      "args": ["-transport", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_MCP_XOXC_TOKEN": "YOUR_XOXC_TOKEN",
        "SLACK_MCP_XOXD_TOKEN": "YOUR_XOXD_TOKEN",
        "SLACK_MCP_USERS_CACHE": "PATH_TO_MCP_SERVER/.users_cache.json",
        "SLACK_MCP_CHANNELS_CACHE": "PATH_TO_MCP_SERVER/.channels_cache.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You should also see your Postiz connector listed in Claude Desktop, under **Settings â†’ Connectors**.

With Slack and Postiz configured in Claude, you can test the integration.

## Testing the integration

Here's a practical scenario: Let's say your team uses ðŸš€ emoji reactions to mark Slack threads that contain insights worth sharing externally. You can ask Claude to find these conversations and turn them into social media posts:

Here is the prompt:

```
Find threads in the #threads channel that have ðŸš€ emoji reactions. Read those thread messages, analyze the key points, and create engaging X posts using the Postiz MCP server.
```

When you run this prompt, Claude searches your Slack workspace, analyzes the marked conversations, and creates optimized posts for your social platforms.

Claude schedules the posts using Postiz, so you can review them at [platform.postiz.com](https://platform.postiz.com/).

## Conclusion

Clause can now automatically turn your best Slack threads into social media posts by finding threads marked with ðŸš€ reactions.

Customize this workflow to suit your team's needs and skills. For example, telling Claude to focus on messages from specific channels or users may help it create content that resonates with your audience.
