Click **Add** to save the connector and restart Claude Desktop.

## Test the integration

Test the integration by asking Claude to generate two short posts and a longer, more detailed post about MCP tools in software engineering.

The short posts work well for X, while the longer post suits LinkedIn better. Here's the prompt:

```txt
Hi Claude! Draft two short X posts and one longer LinkedIn post about why MCP tools are essential for modern software engineering, then use the Postiz MCP server to schedule and publish them across both platforms.
```

Claude drafts the posts and verifies your Postiz configuration.
