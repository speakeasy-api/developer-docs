# Account management with MCP

import GramCallout from "../.partials/gram-callout.mdx";

<GramCallout />

If your team lives in Slack, HubSpot, and an internal ops portal, every task turns into tool-switching: copy a link from Slack, search for the right record in HubSpot, then re-enter the same details into an internal system. It's slow, error-prone, and breaks the flow of work.
The problem is that often you need both external systems (Slack and HubSpot) and internal tools (likely bespoke and hard to change) to move deals forward. Connecting them reliably is a challenge, and getting dev time to polish internal workflows can be difficult.

There's a simpler solution: using MCP servers to connect all your tools so you can handle everything through Claude conversations. With MCP in Claude Desktop, you can connect Slack, HubSpot, and your internal tool in one place, so Claude can orchestrate the steps for you. In this guide, you'll learn how to turn a Slack signal (like a ‼️ reaction) into a HubSpot update, and optionally kick off a simple internal request, all without leaving Claude Desktop.

## What are we building?

We're building an account management workflow that connects Slack, HubSpot, and a simple internal SalesOps API through MCP servers. Reps can ask Claude to find messages with a specific signal in Slack, update HubSpot, and create a small internal request, all in one conversation.

You'll set up three MCP servers:

- A Slack MCP server for finding conversations
- A HubSpot MCP server for updating contacts and tasks
- An internal API MCP server for creating small, auditable SalesOps requests

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install the Slack and HubSpot MCP servers in an MCP client like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).

### Set up the HubSpot and Slack integrations

Follow these guides to add both servers to Claude Desktop:

- [MCP Use Case: Connect Slack](/mcp/using-mcp/mcp-server-providers/slack)
- [MCP Use Case: Connect HubSpot](/mcp/using-mcp/mcp-server-providers/hubspot)

### Test the flow

Let's imagine that your team shares lead updates in a Slack channel called `#leads` and marks urgent messages with the ‼️ emoji. You want Claude to add a "Schedule call ASAP" note to the corresponding lead contacts in HubSpot.

![A screenshot of the Slack channel with the ‼️ emoji reaction](/assets/mcp/using-mcp/account-management/leads-bang-bang.png)

Ask Claude:

```txt
In the #leads Slack channel, find the messages marked with :bangbang: emoji reactions. Use the HubSpot tool to add a note to those contacts advising me to call them ASAP.
```

Claude will:

- Search the `#leads` channel for messages with ‼️ reactions.
- Parse contact information from those messages.
- Look up matching contacts in HubSpot.
- Add a priority note to each contact record.

Once Claude has performed those actions, the contacts in HubSpot will have a "Schedule call ASAP" note added to their records.

At this point, you could stop and manually make account changes for each customer, or you could take the integration a step further and use [Gram](https://getgram.ai) to create a SalesOps MCP server that lets Claude interact with your internal account management system.

## Creating the SalesOps MCP server

Once the Slack and HubSpot integration is working smoothly, you can add your internal tool to the same account management flow.

For this guide, we'll use a lightweight service called SalesOps Bridge as our internal tool. SalesOps Bridge accepts simple requests (like upgrade changes, trial extensions, and temporary feature grants), persists the requests in SQLite, and exposes a read-only `GET /requests` endpoint for dashboards. It ships with a small UI at `http://localhost:3080/`, so we can inspect new requests as Claude creates them.

### Install and run SalesOps Bridge (locally)

- Clone the [SalesOps Bridge repo](https://github.com/ritza-co/salesops-taskmaster-tool).

- Navigate to the `salesops-taskmaster-tool` directory and run the following commands:

  ```bash
  cp .env.template .env
  # Edit .env to set AUTH_TOKEN, this can be any string if you're using it for demo purposes
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```

- Check the health of the service by running a curl request to the health endpoint:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3080/health
  ```

The API exposes an OpenAPI document at `openapi.yaml` within the repository. We'll use this OpenAPI document to generate an MCP server on Gram.

### Expose your local service with ngrok

If you want to test in the Gram playground, you need to expose your local service using ngrok.

- Install ngrok:

  ```bash
  brew install ngrok
  ```

  Alternatively, download it from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download).

- In a new terminal window, start ngrok to expose port 3080:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3080
  ```

- Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL from the ngrok output (it will look like `https://abcd1234.ngrok.app`).

- Update the server URL in `openapi.yaml`. Open the file and replace the placeholder on line 9 with your ngrok URL:

  ```yaml
  servers:
    - url: https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok.app
  ```

Keep the ngrok terminal running while you test with Gram.

### Create the MCP server on Gram

The following video walks you through the process of creating an MCP server on Gram. Follow each of the steps, referring to the [Gram quickstart guide](https://docs.getgram.ai/gram-quickstart) as necessary, to create a SalesOps MCP server:

<video
  controls={false}
  loop={true}
  autoPlay={true}
  muted={true}
  width="100%"
  className="mt-10"
>
  <source src="/assets/mcp/using-mcp/account-management/gram-salesops-internal.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

- Import the SalesOps OpenAPI document into Gram and generate a toolset.
- Fill in your environment variables in the toolset.
- Test the toolset in the Gram Playground.

### Install the MCP server in Claude Desktop

First, create a Gram API key:

- In Gram, navigate to **Settings** in the sidebar, click **New API Key**, select the consumer option, and click **Create**. Copy the API key.

Next, you need to get your MCP configuration and add it to Claude Desktop.

- Navigate to **Toolsets** in the Gram sidebar, select your SalesOps toolset, and open the **MCP** tab.
- Click the **Enable** button, scroll down to the **Managed Authentication** section, and copy the configuration code.

  ![Screenshot of Gram interface showing MCP installation configurations for pass-through and managed authentication options](/assets/mcp/using-mcp/account-management/copy-managed-auth.png)

- In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings → Developer → Edit Config** and add the following entry, replacing the placeholder values with your Gram server slug and API key:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "SalesOpsBridge": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "mcp-remote",
          "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/<your-mcp-server-slug>",
          "--header",
          "Gram-Environment:default",
          "--header",
          "Authorization:${GRAM_KEY}"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GRAM_KEY": "Bearer <your-gram-api-key>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

**Note:** `GET /requests` does not require auth, so Claude can read the dashboard without prompting for approval but still requires your bearer token to perform write actions.

## The complete account management workflow

Your `claude_desktop_config.json` should look something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "SalesOpsBridge": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/<your-mcp-server-slug>",
        "--header",
        "Gram-Environment:default",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${GRAM_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAM_KEY": "Bearer <your-gram-api-key>"
      }
    },
    "HubspotMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hubspot/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PRIVATE_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_HUBSPOT_KEY"
      }
    },
    "SlackMCPServer": {
      "command": "/path/to/slack-mcp-server",
      "args": ["-transport", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_MCP_XOXC_TOKEN": "YOUR_XOXC_TOKEN",
        "SLACK_MCP_XOXD_TOKEN": "YOUR_XOXD_TOKEN",
        "SLACK_MCP_USERS_CACHE": "/path/to/.users_cache.json",
        "SLACK_MCP_CHANNELS_CACHE": "/path/to/.channels_cache.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- To test the complete workflow, open Claude Desktop and send an example prompt similar to the following:

  ```txt
  Find the :bangbang: thread in #leads about Acme. Summarize who asked, what's needed, and timing with the Slack link. Then use HubSpot to add a note and a task due tomorrow at 10:00. Finally, create an internal upgrade request via SalesOps Bridge for +10 seats effective the first of next month, including the Slack thread URL and HubSpot ID.
  ```

    className="mt-10"
  >
    <source src="/assets/mcp/using-mcp/account-management/mcp-account-management-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

- When Claude confirms the request ID, you can verify it by visiting the SalesOps Bridge dashboard at `http://localhost:3080/`.

## Final thoughts

You've built an account management workflow that connects Slack, HubSpot, and a simple internal API through MCP servers.

Because Gram allows you to host API integrations (like the SalesOps Bridge service) without custom server code or infrastructure, you can easily substitute the internal service for any system with an OpenAPI document. Consider how you could adapt this guide for different use cases, such as:

- **Discount approvals:** Capture context from Slack and add CRM notes, then create an approval request internally.
- **Trial extensions:** Log the request in HubSpot and create a short extension via the internal tool.
- **Feature flags:** Record the change in HubSpot and file a time-boxed feature grant internally.

For sensitive actions, we recommend using propose-then-confirm flows so that you can review tool calls before execution.
