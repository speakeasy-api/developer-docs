# Account management with MCP (Slack + Hubspot)

Account management typically involves tracking data across multiple tools. Maybe you discuss potential deals on Slack and then to update leads on Hubspot with that information.

This guide shows you how to automatically update your HubSpot contacts based on Slack messages and emoji reactions. As an example, we'll add a note to the relevant contact on Hubspot if someone adds a ‼️  emoji to a message on Slack that mentions that person, but you can adapt the exact steps to your own workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Slack and HubSpot MCP servers installed. Follow these guides to connect each service individually.
  - [MCP Use Case: Connect Slack](/mcp/using-mcp/mcp-server-providers/slack)
  - [MCP Use Case: Connect HubSpot](/mcp/using-mcp/mcp-server-providers/hubspot)
- An MCP client like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

## Using Slack and Hubspot together with MCP

Let's imagine that your team shares lead updates in a Slack channel called `#leads` and marks urgent ones with the ‼️  emoji. You want Claude to add a "Schedule call ASAP" note to those contacts in HubSpot.

Ask Claude:

```txt
In the #leads Slack channel, find the messages marked with :bangbang: emoji reactions. Use the HubSpot tool to add a note to those contacts that I should call them ASAP.
```

Claude will:

1. Search the #leads channel for messages with ‼️ reactions.
2. Parse contact information from those messages.
3. Look up matching contacts in HubSpot.
4. Add a priority note to each contact record.

The contacts in HubSpot will now have a "schedule call ASAP" note added to their records.

## Best practices for using multiple MCP servers

- **Be specific about which tool to use:** "Use HubSpot to get contact details for John Smith" is better than saying "Get the contact info for John Smith."
- **Design prompts like workflows:** If the steps make sense to you, they'll make sense to Claude. Break complex tasks into clear, sequential actions.
- **Test individual servers first:** Verify each MCP server works independently before combining them in complex workflows.

Combined MCP servers turn Claude Desktop into a powerful automation hub. The key is writing clear prompts that specify which services to use in what order.
