# MCP quickstart guide

This guide walks you through connecting your first MCP server to an AI agent in under 10 minutes. We'll use Claude Desktop as our AI client to add a file to a new project directory on your computer.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Step 1: Install an MCP server

We'll use the [Desktop Commander](https://desktopcommander.app/) MCP server, which lets AI agents use your local filesystem as a tool.

You have two options, depending on your preference:

**The Desktop Commander auto-install script**

To let Desktop Commander install the MCP server for you, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
# Install the Desktop Commander MCP server
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup
```

**Manual installation**

If you prefer to install the MCP server manually (and learn how to install other MCP servers), open Claude Desktop and follow these steps:

<Screenshot
  variant="cli"
  image={{
    src: "/assets/mcp/quickstart/claude-mcp-config.png",
    alt: "A screenshot shows highlighted areas that direct the user to click on the Claude menu item, then on Settings, then on the Developer tab, and finally on Edit Config.",
  }}
/>

1. In the top menu bar, click on the **Claude** menu item.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Go to the **Developer** tab.
4. Click on **Edit Config**.

This opens a Finder or File Explorer window showing the configuration file for Claude Desktop. Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file in a text editor.

Paste the following configuration into the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save the configuration file.

## Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

Close Claude Desktop completely and then reopen it. The MCP server will now be available.

## Step 3: Test the connection

In Claude Desktop, try asking:

> Add a folder to `~/Desktop` called `mcp-test` and create a file called `hello.txt` with the content `Hello, MCP!`

<video
  controls={false}
  loop={true}
  autoPlay={true}
  muted={true}
  width="100%"
  className="mx-auto my-10 max-w-6xl"
  poster="/assets/mcp/quickstart/mcp-test-poster.png"
>
  <source src="/assets/videos/mcp-test.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

As shown in the video above, Claude Desktop executes the command using the MCP server, creating the folder and file on your desktop. The file contains the text `Hello, MCP!`.

## What just happened?

1. **Claude Desktop** sent your prompt to Claude's API along with a message indicating which tools it can use.
2. **Claude's API** responded with a message that included the MCP server's name and the commands to be executed (first, `create_directory`, then `write_file`).
3. **Claude Desktop** sent the commands to the Desktop Commander MCP server.
4. **Desktop Commander** executed the commands on your local file system, creating the folder and file as requested.

Steps 2 to 4 are repeated for each command, allowing the AI agent to see the results of its actions and continue the conversation.

In the end, you see a confirmation message in Claude Desktop notifying you that the folder and file have been created successfully:

> Done. I've created the mcp-test folder in your Desktop directory and added the hello.txt file with the content 'Hello, MCP!' inside it.
