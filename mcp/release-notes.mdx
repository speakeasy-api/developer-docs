## MCP 2025-06-18 vs MCP 2025-03-26

The **2025-06-18** MCP release represents a significant refinement of the Model Context Protocol, introducing structured tool outputs, enhanced OAuth security, and server-initiated user interactions. However, it also removes JSON-RPC batching from the previous version, simplifying protocol implementation while adding new capabilities for better security and data handling.

Key highlights include:

- **Removal of JSON-RPC batching:** The batching feature introduced in 2025-03-26 has been removed, simplifying the protocol implementation
- **Structured tool output:** Tools can now return structured, predictable data formats for better integration
- **Enhanced OAuth security:** MCP servers are now classified as OAuth Resource Servers with additional security requirements
- **Elicitation capability:** Servers can now request additional information from users during interactions
- **Resource links:** Tool results can now reference MCP resources, creating better integration between tools and data

You may choose to remain on the **2025-03-26** version if you need:

- **JSON-RPC batching support:** If your implementation relies on batching multiple requests
- **Simpler OAuth implementation:** The earlier version has less stringent OAuth requirements

## What's new in MCP 2025-06-18?

MCP **2025-06-18** introduces structured tool outputs, removes JSON-RPC batching, enhances OAuth security with Resource Server requirements, and adds elicitation for server-initiated user requests. Here's a detailed breakdown of the major updates:

### Removal of JSON-RPC Batching

One of the most significant changes is the **removal of JSON-RPC batching** support, which was introduced in 2025-03-26. This decision simplifies the protocol implementation and reduces complexity for both clients and servers. The maintainers mentioned that there was ['no compelling use case for batching'](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/416), but not all users agreed.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  If you were using batching in your 2025-03-26 implementation, you'll need to
  refactor to send individual requests instead of batched ones.
</Callout>

### Structured Tool Output

The new [structured tool output](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#structured-content) capability allows tools to return data in predictable, structured formats rather than just plain text responses.

```python
@app.tool("get_user_info", description="Get structured user information")
async def get_user_info(user_id: str):
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "structured",
            "data": {
                "user": {
                    "id": user_id,
                    "name": "John Doe",
                    "email": "john@example.com",
                    "status": "active"
                }
            },
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "user": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "id": {"type": "string"},
                            "name": {"type": "string"},
                            "email": {"type": "string"},
                            "status": {"type": "string"}
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }]
    }
```

### Enhanced OAuth Security

MCP servers are now classified as [OAuth Resource Servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization#authorization-server-discovery):

1. **Resource Server Discovery:** Servers must provide metadata to help clients discover the corresponding Authorization Server
2. **Resource Indicators:** Clients must implement [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html) Resource Indicators to prevent malicious servers from obtaining inappropriate access tokens
3. **Enhanced Security Guidelines:** New [security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices) documentation

### MCP Elicitation Support

The new [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/elicitation) capability enables servers to request additional information from users during interactions, making conversations more dynamic and context-aware.

```python
async def handle_complex_query(query: str, context):
    if missing_context(query):
        # Request additional information from user
        additional_info = await context.elicit_user_input(
            prompt="I need more details about your requirements. What specific format would you like the output in?",
            options=["JSON", "CSV", "Plain text"]
        )
        # Process with additional context
        return process_with_context(query, additional_info)
```

### Resource Links in Tool Results

Tools can now return [resource links](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#resource-links) that reference MCP resources, creating better integration between tool outputs and available data sources.

### MCP Protocol Version Headers

HTTP requests now require the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header to enable [version negotiation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#protocol-version-header):

```http
POST /mcp HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { ... }
}
```

### Other Notable Changes in MCP 2025-06-18

- **Lifecycle Operations:** Changed from **SHOULD** to **MUST** for certain [lifecycle operations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#operation)
- **Meta Fields:** Added `_meta` field to additional interface types for better extensibility
- **Completion Context:** Added `context` field to `CompletionRequest` for LLM-based autocompletion support
- **Title Fields:** Added `title` field for human-friendly display names while keeping `name` as programmatic identifier

## MCP 2025-03-26 vs MCP 2024-11-05

The **2025-03-26** release of the Model Context Protocol introduces a more mature and standardized approach to authorization, transport, and tool metadata. It brings significant improvements in security, flexibility, and client compatibility, but it also includes breaking changes that may require updates in existing implementations if you are moving from the **2024-11-05** version.

Key highlights include:

- **Structured OAuth-style authorization:** Authorization is now defined explicitly using a consistent schema, making supporting various auth models and token types easier.
- **Streamable HTTP transport:** The previous HTTP with SSE model has been replaced with a more robust, proxy-friendly HTTP streaming format.
- **JSON-RPC batching:** Developers can now bundle multiple requests in a single call, improving efficiency in complex workflows (note: this was later removed in 2025-06-18).
- **Tool annotations:** Tools can now describe their behavior (for example, `read-only`, `destructive`), allowing for safer and more user-aware execution.

You may choose to remain on the **2024-11-05** version if you need:

- **SSE-based transport compatibility:** If you're invested in SSE infrastructure and can't yet support chunked HTTP streaming.
- **Minimal tooling overhead:** The earlier version uses simpler schemas and fewer requirements, which may suit prototypes or early integrations.

## What's new in 2025-03-26?

MCP **2025-03-26** introduces the following changes: Authorization framework inspired by OAuth 2.1. and Streamable HTTP replacing HTTP with SSE.

### Authorization

The **2024-11-05** version of MCP doesn't include a standardized authorization model. As a result, developers must implement their own authorization schemes, which leads to inconsistent behaviors and security risks, as tokens are passed directly in the input parameters.

The new model supports role-based access control, dynamic client registration, and standard PKCE-based flows. It also allows for better error handling and smoother integration with existing identity providers.

For example, you might define a tool to make bank transfers as follows:

```python
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.auth import TokenValidator

from apis import banking_api

app = Server("bank-transfer")
token_validator = TokenValidator()

@app.tool("initiateTransfer", description="Send money to another account", args={"amount": int, "recipient": str})
async def initiate_transfer(amount: int, recipient: str, context):
    # Require authentication
    token = context.auth.token
    if not token:
        raise PermissionError("Authentication required")

    # Check if user has permission to transfer funds
    user_roles = token_validator.get_roles(token)
    if "finance-admin" not in user_roles:
        raise PermissionError("Only finance admins can initiate transfers")

    # Proceed with the transfer
    result = await banking_api.transfer_funds(amount, recipient)
    return {"status": result.status, "recipient": recipient, "amount": amount}
```

Learn more about MCP authorization in the [MCP authorization documentation](/mcp/authorization).

### Streamable HTTP transport

In MCP **2024-11-05**, long-lived connections are handled using server-sent events (SSE). SSE supports server-to-client streaming, but client-to-server communication relies on HTTP POST requests. This means managing two different layers of communication, leading to avoidable complexity in coding and implementation.

With version **2025-03-26**, MCP introduces a new transport layer that uses chunked HTTP streaming, replacing SSE. Let's compare the implementation of a streamable HTTP server to the previous SSE-based server.

Here is an example of a simple server using SSE:

```python
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.sse import SseServerTransport
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Route

app = Server("bank-transfer")
sse = SseServerTransport("/messages")

@app.tool("initiateTransfer", args={"amount": int, "recipient": str})
async def initiate_transfer(amount: int, recipient: str, context):
    return {
        "status": "transferred",
        "recipient": recipient,
        "amount": amount
    }

# SSE handler: for persistent GET connection
async def sse_handler(scope, receive, send):
    async with sse.connect_sse(scope, receive, send) as streams:
        await app.run(streams[0], streams[1], app.create_initialization_options())

# POST handler: for sending requests
async def post_handler(scope, receive, send):
    await sse.handle_post_message(scope, receive, send)

starlette_app = Starlette(routes=[
    Route("/sse", sse_handler),
    Route("/messages", post_handler, methods=["POST"])
])
```

Here is the equivalent server using Streamable HTTP:

```python
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.streamable_http_manager import StreamableHTTPSessionManager
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount
from starlette.types import Scope, Receive, Send

app = Server("bank-transfer")
session_manager = StreamableHTTPSessionManager(app=app)

@app.tool("initiateTransfer", args={"amount": int, "recipient": str})
async def initiate_transfer(amount: int, recipient: str, context):
    return {
        "status": "transferred",
        "recipient": recipient,
        "amount": amount
    }

# Streamable HTTP handler
async def handle_streamable_http(scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send):
    await session_manager.handle_request(scope, receive, send)

starlette_app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount("/mcp", app=handle_streamable_http)
    ]
  )
```

Here are some reasons you should consider switching to Streamable HTTP:

- **Proxy and load balancer compatibility:** SSE often breaks under proxies due to connection timeouts and buffering limits. For example, AWS ALB and Cloudflare frequently terminate SSE connections, while Streamable HTTP uses standard chunked encoding and works reliably.
- **Full-duplex communication:** SSE only supports server-to-client messages, requiring separate POSTs for client input. Streamable HTTP enables bidirectional streaming over one connection, simplifying cases like real-time tool execution or chat interfaces.

### Other notable changes

Apart from the improvements to authorization and HTTP streaming transport, MCP **2025-03-26** introduces these changes:

- **Tool calls can now be batched:** Clients may send multiple tool invocations in a single JSON-RPC request. Servers that assume one call per request must handle arrays and concurrent execution. (Note: This feature was removed in 2025-06-18)
- **Tool behavior must now be declared explicitly:** Tools can define attributes like `readOnly` or `destructive`, which clients are expected to respect. This may impact how tools are displayed or gated in UIs.
- **Progress updates are now more descriptive:** The `ProgressNotification` object includes an optional `message` field. Clients that display progress may want to surface these descriptions to users.
- **Audio is a supported content type:** Servers and clients must now handle `audio` in addition to `text` and `image`.
- **Tools can advertise completion support:** Servers can declare that a tool supports input autocompletion. You may need to update your UI to initiate and render completion suggestions accordingly.
