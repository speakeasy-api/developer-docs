# What are MCP tools?

MCP tools are callable functions that MCP servers expose to the client. They allow clients to interact with real-world external environments, for example, by querying databases, calling APIs, writing files, triggering workflows, and more.re.

Tools are how clients can perform actions and trigger side effects using MCP.

## Lifecycle and request and response formats

Each tool lifecycle follows this pattern:

1. The server registers a tool with a name, input parameters, output schema, and description.
2. The client calls `tools/list` to discover available tools.
3. The client calls `tools/call` with the tool `name` and `arguments`.
4. The server calls the tool function with the provided arguments.
5. The server runs the tool and returns a result or an error message.

Clients call tools using the `tools/call` method with structured arguments. Here is an example of a tool call request payload:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "write_note",
    "arguments": {
      "slug": "morning",
      "content": "Start your day with clarity and confidence."
    }
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

The `name` field is the name of the tool to call. The `arguments` field is an object containing the arguments to pass to the tool. The `id` field is a unique identifier for the request.

The response to a tool call has the following structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "status": "saved",
    "slug": "morning"
  }
}
```

If an error occurs, the response must conform to the standard JSON-RPC error format.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "error": {
    "code": 2050,
    "message": "Invalid parameters",
    "data": {
      "name": "write_note",
      "arguments": {
        "slug": "morning",
        "content": "Start your day with clarity and confidence."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Declaring a tool request in Python

To declare a tool, you annotate a function with the `@tool` decorator. A tool must accept and return only JSON-serializable data types such as `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, and `None`.

The example below shows how to declare a tool using the [official Python SDK for MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) to place a stock trade using the Alpaca API.

```python
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp import types
from mcp.server import stdio

import requests
import asyncio

app = Server("alpaca-order-server")

ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
ALPACA_API_SECRET = "your_api_secret"
ALPACA_BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2"

HEADERS = {
    "APCA-API-KEY-ID": ALPACA_API_KEY,
    "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY": ALPACA_API_SECRET,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

@app.list_tools()
async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
    return [
        types.Tool(
            name="place_stock_order",
            description="Place a stock trade via the Alpaca paper trading API",
            inputSchema={
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "symbol": {"type": "string"},
                    "qty": {"type": "integer"},
                    "side": {"type": "string", "enum": ["buy", "sell"]},
                    "order_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["market", "limit"]},
                    "time_in_force": {"type": "string", "enum": ["day", "gtc"]},
                    "limit_price": {"type": "number"}
                },
                "required": ["symbol", "qty", "side", "order_type", "time_in_force"]
            }
        )
    ]

@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list[types.TextContent]:
    if name != "place_stock_order":
        raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {name}")

    symbol = arguments["symbol"].upper()
    qty = arguments["qty"]
    side = arguments["side"].lower()
    order_type = arguments["order_type"].lower()
    time_in_force = arguments["time_in_force"].lower()
    limit_price = arguments.get("limit_price")

    order_payload = {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "qty": qty,
        "side": side,
        "type": order_type,
        "time_in_force": time_in_force
    }

    if order_type == "limit" and limit_price:
        order_payload["limit_price"] = limit_price

    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{ALPACA_BASE_URL}/orders",
            headers=HEADERS,
            json=order_payload
        )
        data = response.json()
        message = f"Order placed: {side.upper()} {qty} {symbol} @ {order_type.upper()}"
        return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=message)]

    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Failed to place order for {symbol}: {str(e)}"
        return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=error_msg)]
```

In this example, we:

- **Register a tool called `place_stock_order`** with a clear description and a JSON Schema specifying required inputs like `symbol`, `qty`, `side`, `order_type`, and `time_in_force`.
- **Use `@list_tools` to expose the tool metadata** to the client. This is how agents and UI tools like Claude Desktop discover available tools dynamically at runtime.
- **Implement `@call_tool` to handle the execution logic.** When the tool is invoked by the client, the server builds an HTTP request to the Alpaca API using the provided arguments.
- **Format a confirmation message summarizing the placed order.** The result is returned as a `TextContent` object, which is compatible with standard MCP tool responses.

We also make sure errors and missing data are handled gracefully, returning fallback messages if the API request fails.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  The Python SDK also provides a higher-level interface called `FastMCP`,
  originally introduced in [FastMCP
  1.0](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v1.0), which simplifies
  tool declarations. The example above uses the low-level API, which is
  recommended only when you need fine-grained control over the tool lifecycle.

## Error handling

MCP distinguishes between two types of errors, which must be handled in different ways.

### 1. Protocol-level errors

Use protocol-level errors (such as thrown exceptions or JSON-RPC error responses) only in the following cases:

- Tool not found
- Permission denied
- Invalid parameter format
- Server-side exceptions unrelated to tool functionality

```python
@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list[types.TextContent]:
    # Protocol-level error - tool not found
    if name not in AVAILABLE_TOOLS:
        raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {name}")
```

### 2. Tool execution errors

Use structured error responses within successful JSON-RPC responses for:

- Logic errors during tool execution
- Invalid values
- Failed operations
- Any error the LLM should see and handle

```python
@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list[types.TextContent]:
    if name == "place_order":
        try:
            # Attempt the operation
            result = place_order(arguments)
            return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=result)]
        except OrderError as e:
            # Tool execution error - returned as content with isError=True
            return [types.TextContent(
                type="text",
                text=f"Error placing order: {str(e)}"
            )]
```

This distinction matters because, while protocol-level errors aren't seen by the LLM, tool execution errors are returned as content, allowing the model to reason about errors and retry or change its strategy.

## Best practices and pitfalls to avoid

Here are some best practices to follow when writing MCP tools:

- **Keep names clear and purposeful:** Agents or LLMs can use tool names in decision-making.
- **Validate all inputs:** Never assume the client sends valid or safe data.
- **Write good docstrings:** These become the tool descriptions in discovery and are often seen by agents or LLMs.
- **Return structured results:** Use JSON objects with consistent shape and semantics.
- **Keep tools deterministic:** Clients expect the same inputs to produce the same outputs unless side effects are explicit and intentional.

Avoid these common pitfalls:

- Irreversible side effects without confirmation. Use [sampling](/mcp/sampling) for validation if needed.
- Unsafe commands (for example, `os.system`) or raw DB access.
- Complex or deeply nested input schemas that are hard to validate.
- Global state unless scoped per session.
- Returning raw strings unless free-form output is the intent.

MCP tools are often confused with [MCP resources](/mcp/resources), which are named, read-only data references addressable via URIs. Learn more about the difference in the Resources vs Tools section of the [MCP resources documentation](/mcp/resources#resources-vs-tools).
