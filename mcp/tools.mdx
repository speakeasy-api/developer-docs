# What are MCP Tools?

MCP Tools are callable functions that MCP servers expose to the client. They allow interactions with real-world external environments, like querying databases, calling APIs, writing files, triggering workflows, and more.

Tools are how clients can perform actions and trigger side effects using MCP.

## Lifecycle and request and response formats

Each tool lifecycle follows this pattern:

1. The server registers a tool with a name, input parameters, output schema, and description.
2. The client calls `tools/list` to discover available tools.
3. The client calls `tools/call` with the tool `name` and `arguments`.
4. The server calls the tool function with the provided arguments.
5. The server runs the tool and returns a result or an error message.

Clients call tools using the `tools/call` method with structured arguments. Here is an example of a tool call request payload:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "write_note",
    "arguments": {
      "slug": "morning",
      "content": "Start your day with clarity and confidence."
    }
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

The `name` field is the name of the tool to call. The `arguments` field is an object containing the arguments to pass to the tool. The `id` field is a unique identifier for the request.

The response to a tool call has the following structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "status": "saved",
    "slug": "morning"
  }
}
```

If an error occurs, the response must conform to the standard JSON-RPC error format.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "error": {
    "code": 2050,
    "message": "Invalid parameters",
    "data": {
      "name": "write_note",
      "arguments": {
        "slug": "morning",
        "content": "Start your day with clarity and confidence."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Declaring a tool request in Python

To declare a tool, you annotate a function with the `@tool` decorator. A tool must accept and return only JSON-serializable data types such as `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, and `None`.

The example below shows how to declare a tool using the [official Python SDK for MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) to place a stock trade using the Alpaca API.

```python
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp import types
from mcp.server import stdio

import requests
import asyncio

app = Server("alpaca-order-server")

ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
ALPACA_API_SECRET = "your_api_secret"
ALPACA_BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2"

HEADERS = {
    "APCA-API-KEY-ID": ALPACA_API_KEY,
    "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY": ALPACA_API_SECRET,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

@app.list_tools()
async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
    return [
        types.Tool(
            name="place_stock_order",
            description="Place a stock trade via the Alpaca paper trading API",
            inputSchema={
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "symbol": {"type": "string"},
                    "qty": {"type": "integer"},
                    "side": {"type": "string", "enum": ["buy", "sell"]},
                    "order_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["market", "limit"]},
                    "time_in_force": {"type": "string", "enum": ["day", "gtc"]},
                    "limit_price": {"type": "number"}
                },
                "required": ["symbol", "qty", "side", "order_type", "time_in_force"]
            }
        )
    ]

@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list[types.TextContent]:
    if name != "place_stock_order":
        raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {name}")

    symbol = arguments["symbol"].upper()
    qty = arguments["qty"]
    side = arguments["side"].lower()
    order_type = arguments["order_type"].lower()
    time_in_force = arguments["time_in_force"].lower()
    limit_price = arguments.get("limit_price")

    order_payload = {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "qty": qty,
        "side": side,
        "type": order_type,
        "time_in_force": time_in_force
    }

    if order_type == "limit" and limit_price:
        order_payload["limit_price"] = limit_price

    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{ALPACA_BASE_URL}/orders",
            headers=HEADERS,
            json=order_payload
        )
        data = response.json()
        message = f"Order placed: {side.upper()} {qty} {symbol} @ {order_type.upper()}"
        return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=message)]

    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Failed to place order for {symbol}: {str(e)}"
        return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=error_msg)]
```

In this example, we:

- **Register a tool called `place_stock_order`** with a clear description and a JSON Schema specifying required inputs like `symbol`, `qty`, `side`, `order_type`, and `time_in_force`.
- **Use `@list_tools` to expose the tool metadata** to the client. This is how agents and UI tools like Claude desktop discover available tools dynamically at runtime.
- **Implement `@call_tool` to handle the execution logic.** When the tool is invoked by the client, the server builds an HTTP request to the Alpaca API using the provided arguments.
- **Format a confirmation message summarizing the placed order.** The result is returned as a `TextContent` object, which is compatible with standard MCP tool responses.

We also make sure errors and missing data are handled gracefully, returning fallback messages if the API request fails.

  The Python SDK also provides a higher-level interface called `FastMCP`, which simplifies tool declarations. The example above uses the low-level API, which is recommended only when you need fine-grained control over the tool lifecycle.

## Error handling

MCP distinguishes between two types of errors, which must be handled in different ways.

### 1. Protocol-level errors

Use protocol-level errors (such as thrown exceptions or JSON-RPC error responses) only in the following cases:

- Tool not found
- Permission denied
- Invalid parameter format
- Server-side exceptions unrelated to tool functionality

```python
@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list[types.TextContent]:
    # Protocol-level error - tool not found
    if name not in AVAILABLE_TOOLS:
        raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {name}")
```

### 2. Tool execution errors

Use structured error responses within successful JSON-RPC responses for:

- Logic errors during tool execution
- Invalid values
- Failed operations
- Any error the LLM should see and handle

```python
@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list[types.TextContent]:
    if name == "place_order":
        try:
            # Attempt the operation
            result = place_order(arguments)
            return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=result)]
        except OrderError as e:
            # Tool execution error - returned as content with isError=True
            return [types.TextContent(
                type="text",
                text=f"Error placing order: {str(e)}"
            )]
```

This distinction matters because, while protocol-level errors aren't seen by the LLM, tool execution errors are returned as content, allowing the model to reason about errors and retry or change its strategy.

## Best practices and pitfalls to avoid

Here are some best practices to follow when writing MCP tools:

- **Keep names clear and purposeful:** Agents or LLMs can use tool names in decision-making.
- **Validate all inputs:** Never assume the client sends valid or safe data.
- **Write good docstrings:** These become the tool descriptions in discovery and are often seen by agents or LLMs.
- **Return structured results:** Use JSON objects with consistent shape and semantics.
- **Keep tools deterministic:** Clients expect the same inputs to produce the same outputs unless side effects are explicit and intentional.

Avoid these common pitfalls:

- Irreversible side effects without confirmation. Use [sampling](/mcp/sampling) for validation if needed.
- Unsafe commands (for example, `os.system`) or raw DB access.
- Complex or deeply nested input schemas that are hard to validate.
- Global state unless scoped per session.
- Returning raw strings unless free-form output is the intent.

MCP Tools are often confused with [MCP Resources](/mcp/resources), which are named, read-only data references addressable via URIs. Learn more about the difference in the Resources vs Tools section of the [MCP Resources documentation](/mcp/resources#resources-vs-tools).
