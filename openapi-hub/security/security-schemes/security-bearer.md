# Bearer Security Scheme in OpenAPI

The Bearer security scheme allows passing a token (most commonly a JWT) in the Authorization header.

A Bearer security scheme is generally used for short-lived tokens granted to your API users through an additional login mechanism. Using a JWT allows for storing additional metadata within the token, which can be helpful for some use cases, such as storing scopes for permissions models.

The fields for a Bearer security scheme are as follows:

| Field         | Type                              | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | String                            | ✅       | `http`                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `description` | String                            |          | Human-readable information. This may contain [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to provide a rich description.                                                         |
| `scheme`      | String                            | ✅       | `bearer`                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `bearerFormat` | String                            |          | A hint to the client to identify how the bearer token is formatted. Bearer tokens are usually generated by an authorization server, so this information is primarily for documentation purposes. |
| `x-*`         | [Extensions](/openapi/extensions) |          | Any number of extension fields can be added to the security scheme object to be used by tooling and vendors. |

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    auth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
security:
  - auth: []
```
