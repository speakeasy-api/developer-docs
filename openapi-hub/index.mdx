### OpenAPI Overview

<div>

## !!steps \`openapi`

The version of the OpenAPI Specification that the document conforms to, should be one of the [supported versions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/main/versions).

**Note**: Speakeasy tooling currently only supports OpenAPI Specification versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x.

## !!steps \`info`

Contains information about the document including fields like `title`, `version`, and `description` that help to identify the purpose and owner of the document.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(2:4)
```

---

## !!steps \`servers`

Contains an optional list of servers the API is available on. If not provided, the default URL is assumed to be `/`, a path relative to where the OpenAPI document is hosted.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(5:7)
```

---

## !!steps \`security`

Contains an optional list of security requirements that apply to all operations in the API. If not provided, the default security requirements are assumed to be `[]`, an empty array.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(8:9)
```

---

## !!steps \`tags`

Contains an optional list of tags that are generally used to group or categorize a set of [Operations](/openapi/paths/operations).

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(10:12,16:17)
```

---

## !!steps \`paths`

Contains the paths and operations available within the API.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(13:28)
```

---

## !!steps \`components`

Contains an optional list of reusable schemas that can be referenced from other parts of the document. This improves the readability and maintainability of the document by allowing common schemas to be defined once and reused in multiple places.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(29:42)
```
