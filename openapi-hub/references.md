# References ($ref) in OpenAPI

While creating an OpenAPI schema, you might notice duplicated parts in your document. Using references in OpenAPI helps you define a schema once and reuse it elsewhere in the document. This approach minimizes duplication and makes your OpenAPI document more readable and maintainable.

To reference a schema, use the `$ref` keyword followed by the path to the schema. The path can be an absolute or relative URI and can also refer to objects in different files.

## OpenAPI Reference Object

Any object supported by the [Components Object](./components.md) can be replaced by an OpenAPI Reference Object. A Reference Object points to a component using the `$ref` field, which is itself a [JSON Schema Reference](#json-schema-references) and can optionally override the `summary` or `description` of the referenced object.

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$ref`        | String | âœ…       | A [JSON Schema reference](#json-schema-references) to a component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `summary`     | String |          | A summary that overrides the referenced component's `summary` field. This field is ignored if the referenced component's type does not support the `summary` field.                                                                                                                        |
| `description` | String |          | A detailed description that overrides the referenced component's `description` field. This field is ignored if the referenced component's type does not support the `description` field. This may contain [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to provide a rich description. |

In the example below, we define a `Drink` schema in the `components` section:

```yaml  openapi.yaml mark=3:11
components:
  schemas:
    Drink:
      type: object
      summary: A drink in the bar
      description: A drink that can be ordered in the bar
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        recipe:
          type: string
```

We can reference this component in API paths using a Reference Object:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=10:11
paths:
  /drinks:
    post:
      summary: Create a new drink
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Drink" # References the Drink schema
              summary: A drink to add to the bar # Overrides the Drink schema summary
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
```

In this example, the `Drink` schema is referenced in the `requestBody` of the `POST /drinks` operation. The `summary` field in the Reference Object overrides the `summary` field of the `Drink` schema.

## JSON Schema References in OpenAPI

OpenAPI inherits the flexible JSON Schema `$ref` keyword. A JSON Schema reference is an absolute or relative URI that points to a property in the current schema or an external schema. Relative references are resolved using the current document's location as the base URI. Paths inside `$ref` use JSON Pointer syntax (JSON Pointer is different from JSONPath, which is not part of JSON Schema).

The JSON Schema `$ref` can reference elements within the same schema or external schemas, or the path defined inside an object's `$id` field. By contrast, OpenAPI Reference Objects are focused on referencing components defined within the `components` section of an OpenAPI document and allow for overriding the `summary` and `description` metadata of the referenced component.

The `$id` field in JSON Schema provides a unique identifier for a schema that `$ref` can reference. The `$id` field must be a URI.

Most objects in a schema are themselves valid schemas and can thus have an `$id` field. Note that `$id`, not `id`, is a keyword in JSON schema and should be used for references.

## JSON Schema Reference Escape Characters

The `/` character separates segments in a JSON Pointer, for instance, `$ref: "#/components/schemas/Drink"`.

To refer to a property that contains the `/` character in its name, escape `/` in the `$ref` using `~1`. Since `~` is the escape character in paths, `~` must be escaped as `~0`.

For example, consider the JSON object below:

```json example.json
{"a/b": { "c~d": "value" }}
```

To create a pointer to `value`, you would need to use the string `/a~1b/c~0d`.

## Types of References in OpenAPI

References in OpenAPI can be relative or absolute. Relative references point to elements within the same API description, while absolute references point to elements in external documents. Absolute references can also point to external resources like online JSON files. Runtime expressions are another type of reference that allows for dynamic values during API execution.

| `$ref` string                       | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#/components/schemas/Drink`        | References the `Drink` schema in the `components` section of the current file.                                 |
| `./person.yaml`                     | References the entire `person.yaml` file. The entire content of `person.yaml` is used.                         |
| `../person.yaml`                    | References the `person.yaml` file in the parent directory. The entire content of `person.yaml` is used.        |
| `./people.yaml#/Person`             | References the `Person` schema in the `people.yaml` file. Only the `Person` schema from `people.yaml` is used. |
| `https://pastebin.com/raw/LAvtwJn6` | References an external schema stored online. The entire content of the external schema is used.                |
| `$request.path.orderId`             | A runtime expression that passes the `orderId` from the parent operation.                                      |


### Relative References in OpenAPI

Relative references specify a location based on the current document and are useful for referencing elements within the same API description.

In the example below, the reference points to the `Drink` schema defined within the `components` section of the current OpenAPI document:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=9
paths:
  /order:
    post:
      summary: Place an order for a drink
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Drink" # Relative reference to the Drink schema
```

### Absolute References in OpenAPI

Absolute references include a protocol like `http://` or `https://` followed by the rest of the URI.

The example below references an `Ingredient` component in a remote OpenAPI document:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=13:14
paths:
  /drinks:
    get:
      summary: Get ingredients
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  # Absolute reference to an external schema
                  $ref: "https://speakeasy.bar/schemas/ingredients.yaml#/components/schemas/Ingredient"
```

### Runtime Expressions in OpenAPI

Runtime expressions allow for dynamically determining values during API execution. These expressions add flexibility and reduce the need for hard coding details in an API description.

Expressions in OpenAPI always begin with the dollar sign `$` and indicate the string that follows must be calculated from the HTTP request or response. To embed an expression in another string, wrap it in `{}`.

Runtime expressions are commonly used in [Link Objects](./paths/operations/responses/links.md#link-object) and [Callbacks Objects](./paths/operations/callbacks.md#callback-object) to pass dynamic values to linked operations or callbacks. An example is:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=9
paths:
  /orders/{orderId}:
    get:
      # ...
    links:
      viewItems:
        operationId: getOrderItems
        parameters:
          orderId: $request.path.orderId # Pass orderId from the parent operation
```

## Additional Syntax

The following sections show some more advanced ways of using references to structure an API neatly.

As the basis of the examples to follow, the following `openapi.yaml` describes a single operation that takes a person's ID and returns their name:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=5:25
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Person API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /persons/{id}:
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  id:
                    type: string
                  name:
                    type: string
```

### Local File References

The definition of the type that is returned can be moved into its own file so that other operations or other files can use it, too. The operation's `responses` object in `openapi.yaml` now has a `$ref` field:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=7
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: 'person.yaml' # Reference to the person schema in a separate file
```

In this example, the `$ref` uses a relative path that points to the entire `person.yaml` file in the same folder with the following content:

```yaml person.yaml
type: object
properties:
  id:
    type: string
  name:
    type: string
```

### Online File References in OpenAPI

Schemas can be stored online, for example, in [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com). The reference in `openapi.yaml` can refer to the online `Person` definition:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=7
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "https://pastebin.com/raw/LAvtwJn6"
```

The content of the `Person` schema is stored in the Pastebin link `https://pastebin.com/raw/LAvtwJn6`:

```yaml https://pastebin.com/raw/LAvtwJn6
type: object
properties:
  id:
    type: string
  name:
    type: string
```

### Organize Schemas and Components in Files in OpenAPI

While it is common practice to define an OpenAPI document's schemas and components in a single file, a schema _may_ be split across multiple files using references.

In a JSON schema file containing multiple objects, the `Person` object might look like this:

```yaml people.yaml mark=1:7
Person:
  type: object
  properties:
    id:
      type: string
    name:
      type: string

Employee:
  ...

Student:
  ...
```

The `openapi.yaml` OpenAPI document can reference the `Person` schema from `people.yaml` using the filename and path:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=7
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "people.yaml#/Person"
```

### Nested References in OpenAPI

References can be nested so that a schema can reference another schema that references a third schema. In the example below, the `Person` schema references the `Address` schema, which in turn references the `Country` schema:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=11,20
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
        address:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Address"
    Address:
      type: object
      properties:
        street:
          type: string
        city:
          type: string
        country:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Country"
    Country:
      type: string
```

### Circular References in OpenAPI

Circular references are valid in OpenAPI and useful to define recursive objects. In the example below, the `Person` component is redefined to have an array of children, with each child a circular reference to `Person`.

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=10:13
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
        children:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Person'
```

Although tooling may pass a schema as syntactically valid, it could still be logically unusable. For example, code generation tools that generate SDKs or example requests and responses will fail when used on the schema below that has an infinitely recursive reference:

```yaml infinite-recursion.yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Human'
    Human:
      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Person'
```

### Composition in OpenAPI

The `$ref` keyword can be used to compose schemas of multiple objects.

Using composition in schemas is described in [`allOf`, `anyOf`, and `oneOf`](./schemas/objects/polymorphism.md).

The `$ref` keywords used in the examples in that explanation could be external file references instead of component references.

### Arrays and Objects in OpenAPI

The `$ref` keyword can be used to replace an entire array or individual items in the array.

However, some fields in an OpenAPI schema require each array item or object property to be referenced individually and the entire field may not be replaced with one `$ref`. The fields that must list each item separately are `servers`, `tags`, `paths`, `security`, `securitySchemes/scopes`, and `components`.

## Object Type Examples in OpenAPI

This section gives examples for all the places `$ref` can be used.

Objects referenced can be in a `components` section of the schema or a separate file. The first example below shows both options, the rest of the examples illustrate referencing objects in the `components` section only.

### Referencing Parameters in OpenAPI

The parameters for the operation `listDrinks`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
      parameters:
        - name: type
          in: query
          description: The type of drink to filter by. If not provided all drinks will be returned.
          required: false
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/DrinkType"
```

The same schema with a reference to the `components` section:

```yaml openapi.yaml
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/DrinkTypeParameter'
# ...
components:
  parameters:
    DrinkTypeParameter:
      name: type
      in: query
      description: The type of drink to filter by. If not provided all drinks will be returned.
      required: false
      schema:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/DrinkType'
  schemas:
    DrinkType:
# ...
```

The schema using an external file reference instead of `components`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
      parameters:
        - $ref: 'parameters.yaml#/DrinkTypeParameter'
```

The contents of the referenced `parameters.yaml` file (note that the main schema file is referenced in turn from the `openapi.yaml` file):

```yaml parameters.yaml
DrinkTypeParameter:
  name: type
  in: query
  description: The type of drink to filter by. If not provided all drinks will be returned.
  required: false
  schema:
    $ref: 'openapi.yaml#/components/schemas/DrinkType'
```

### Referencing Request Bodies in OpenAPI

The `requestBody` for the operation `authenticate`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                username:
                  type: string
                password:
                  type: string
```

The same schema using a reference to the `components` section:

```yaml openapi.yaml
      requestBody:
        $ref: '#/components/requestBodies/UserCredentials'
# ...
components:
  requestBodies:
    UserCredentials:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              username:
                type: string
              password:
                type: string
```

### Referencing Error Types in OpenAPI

All operations in the Bar schema already use references for error types:

```yaml openapi.yaml
      responses:
        "200":
          description: The api key to use for authenticated endpoints.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  token:
                    type: string
        "401":
          description: Invalid credentials provided.
        "5XX":
          $ref: "#/components/responses/APIError"
        default:
          $ref: "#/components/responses/UnknownError"
...
components:
  responses:
    APIError:
      description: An error occurred interacting with the API.
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/APIError"
    UnknownError:
      description: An unknown error occurred interacting with the API.
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Error"
```

### Referencing Security Schemes in OpenAPI

Security schemes automatically reference `components` and do not need `$ref`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths
  /drinks:
    post:
      operationId: createDrink
      summary: Create a drink.
      description: Create a drink. Only available when authenticated.
      security:
        - apiKey: []
...
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKey:
      type: apiKey
      name: Authorization
      in: header
```

Referencing schemes in a separate file:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    $ref: 'securitySchemes.yaml'
```

### Referencing Schema Examples in OpenAPI

In the `responses` section of the `listDrinks` operation, `examples` use `$ref`:

```yaml
      responses:
        "200":
          description: A list of drinks.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  oneOf:
                    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Drink"
                    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/PublicDrink"
                  discriminator:
                    propertyName: dataLevel
                    mapping:
                      unauthenticated: "#/components/schemas/PublicDrink"
                      authenticated: "#/components/schemas/Drink"
              examples:
                unauthenticated_drinks:
                  $ref: "#/components/examples/unauthenticated_drinks"
...
components:
  examples:
    unauthenticated_drinks:
      summary: A list of drinks for unauthenticated users
      value:
        [
          {
            "name": "Old Fashioned",
            "type": "cocktail",
            "price": 1000,
            "photo": "https://speakeasy.bar/drinks/old_fashioned.jpg",
            "dataLevel": "unauthenticated",
          },
          ...
        ]
```

The schemes in a separate file can be referenced like this:

```yaml
components:
  examples:
    $ref: 'examples.yaml'
```

### Discriminators in OpenAPI

[Discriminators](./schemas/objects/polymorphism.md#discriminator-object) can be used to differentiate between different schemas in a `oneOf` array.

The `mapping` object in a discriminator maps values to schemas. The references in these mappings are similar to the values used in `$ref`.

In the example below, the drinks returned by the `listDrinks` operation can be either `Cocktail` or `Beer`:

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=14:16
      responses:
        "200":
          description: A list of drinks.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  oneOf:
                    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Cocktail"
                    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Beer"
                  discriminator:
                    propertyName: category

## References Best Practices in OpenAPI

There are no syntactical or functional differences between a schema in one file or split into multiple files using `$ref`. But splitting a large schema into separate files implements the principle of modularity, which holds several advantages for users:

- Readability: Multiple shorter files with appropriate names are easier to navigate and understand than one massive file.
- Reusability: Multiple top-level schemas that are unrelated can reuse lower-level schemas stored in shared external files.
- Collaboration: Programmers can more easily edit smaller files in their area of focus in an API without version control conflicts.

A minor disadvantage of using multiple files is increased administration. Deployments need to carefully validate and distribute multiple files with interdependencies instead of just one file. The separate files may be stored in different locations on a network and have complicated URI resolutions, though this is usually unnecessary.

Given that splitting a schema into several files is beneficial, let's consider how to do it. Here are some principles to consider:

### Use External Files Sparingly

A potential downside of separating your OpenAPI documents into multiple files with references is that online validators can't validate multiple files at once. When using multiple documents, you can validate your OpenAPI schema using local validators. For example:

```sh
npx swagger-cli validate openapi.yaml
```

If both files are present and valid, the validator will return `openapi.yaml is valid`.

### Use Components When Necessary

Don't waste time on premature optimization or modularization. If you're using a type only once, don't bother moving it into components. But as soon as you use a type twice, use two `$ref` keywords in your main schema, and move the type definition down into `components`. Now if you want to split your file into multiple files, your types are already modules.

When should you break your `components` section into multiple files? Either when the file becomes too large to be easily readable, or when you start writing another API that reuses the same components as your original one.

### Design Versioning Carefully

It is important to specify the version number of your schemas so that customers can be certain they are calling the correct API for the code they have written. As well as having a version number in your YAML, you should also number your schema filenames or use Git release numbers:

```txt
â”œâ”€â”€ schema-v1.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ schema-v2.yaml
```

When you split your schema into multiple files, it's easier to do versioning at the folder level:

```txt
â”œâ”€â”€ api
    â”œâ”€â”€ v1
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ openapi.yaml
    |   â””â”€â”€ person.yaml
    â””â”€â”€ v2
        â”œâ”€â”€ openapi.yaml
        â””â”€â”€ person.yaml
```

Even if only `openapi.yaml` changes when releasing a new version, and `person.yaml` remains the same, it is simpler to copy all files into the new version folder rather than referencing the old `person.yaml` from both `openapi.yaml` files. There is too much risk of making a change in one version of a file that breaks other files depending on it.

If multiple APIs share common components, versioning becomes more complex. Consider the example below.

```txt
â”œâ”€â”€ api
|   â”œâ”€â”€ v1
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ bar-schema.yaml
|   |   â””â”€â”€ employee-schema.yaml
|   â””â”€â”€ v2
|       â”œâ”€â”€ bar-schema.yaml
|       â””â”€â”€ employee-schema.yaml
|
â””â”€â”€ shared
    â”œâ”€â”€ v1
    |   â””â”€â”€ person.yaml
    â””â”€â”€ v2
        â””â”€â”€ person.yaml
```

Two APIs, Bar and Employee, use the person schema kept in a shared folder. When version 1 of the person schema is updated for the Bar API, you need to either:
- The Employee API must be updated and a new version released. Since there have been no functional changes to the API, there is no benefit to customers updating their code that uses the API. This is a poor solution.
- The file should no longer be shared. Different versions of the `person.yaml` file should be moved into the Bar and Employee folders and deleted from the `shared` folder. This solution discards the modularity and reusability of shared files.
- The Bar API version 2 should point to the person schema version 2, and the Employee API version 1 should point to the person schema version 1.

The final solution makes the most sense, but is dangerous. You'll need to keep track of which versions of the APIs point to which version of the shared schema, and further changes to `person.yaml` version 1 could cause it to diverge from version 2, and you'll need to implement one of the three solutions above again.

Note that `$ref` has no version checking. You need to create your own scripts to validate the versioning system and folder structure your company decides to use.

### How To Structure Your Files

In general, choose filenames that match the file contents, such as `parameters.yaml`, `responses.yaml`, or `securitySchemes.yaml`. Group each type of object into a single file, such as `schemas`, `examples`, and so on.

A simple folder structure might look like this:

```txt
/api
  openapi.yaml
  /components
    schemas.yaml
    responses.yaml
    parameters.yaml
    examples.yaml
    security.yaml
  /paths
    users.yaml
    products.yaml
```

When referencing external files, use clear and relative paths that make it easy to understand where the referenced file is located relative to the current file. Don't chain references more than two levels. Deep nesting is difficult to understand.

Each file should be alphabetically structured to make finding elements easy.
