# Composition and Inheritance in OpenAPI

import { Table } from "@/components/ui/Table";

OpenAPI allows us to combine object schemas using the keywords `allOf`, `anyOf`, and `oneOf`.

These keywords correspond to the following logical operators:

<Table
  data={[
    { keyword: "`oneOf`", operator: "`XOR`", description: "An exclusive disjunction. Instances must satisfy **exactly one of** A, B, or C.", howToUse: "Use for describing Union Types" },
    { keyword: "`allOf`", operator: "`AND`", description: "A union of all subschemas. Instances must satisfy **all of** A, B, and C.", howToUse: "Use for describing model composition: the creation of complex schemas via the composition of simpler schemas." },
    { keyword: "`anyOf`", operator: "`OR`", description: "An inclusive disjunction. Instances must satisfy **at least one of** A, B, or C.", howToUse: "There is no established convention about how anyOf should be interpreted. **Use with extreme caution**" }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "keyword", header: "Keyword" },
    { key: "operator", header: "Operator" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" },
    { key: "howToUse", header: "How to use" }
  ]}
/>

The example below illustrates the different composition keywords:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    # ... Other schemas ...
    Negroni:
      description: A Negroni cocktail. Contains gin, vermouth and campari.
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Vermouth"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Gin"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Campari"
    Martini:
      description: A Martini cocktail. Contains gin and vermouth, or vodka and vermouth.
      oneOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Vodka"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Gin"
      - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Vermouth"
    Punch:
      description: A Punch cocktail. Contains any combination of alcohol.
      anyOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Rum"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Brandy"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Whisky"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Vodka"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Gin"
```

## Discriminator Object in OpenAPI

When using `oneOf` to indicate that a request body or response contains exactly one of multiple [Schema Objects](/openapi/schemas), a discriminator object can help the client or server figure out which schema is included in the request or response.

The discriminator object in OpenAPI tells a client or server which field can be used to discriminate between different schemas.

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`propertyName`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The property name used to discriminate between schemas." },
    { field: "`mapping`", type: "Map[string, string]", required: "", description: "An optional map of values and schema reference strings." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to the discriminator object that can be used by tooling and vendors." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

In the example below, the Speakeasy Bar can receive one of two order types: A drink order with a bar-counter reference or an ingredient order with a delivery address:

```yaml
components:
  responses:
    OrderResponse:
      oneOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/DrinkOrder"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/IngredientOrder"
```

If we include a discriminator object, the client can indicate the order type so that the server does not need to figure that out:

```yaml
components:
  responses:
    OrderResponse:
      oneOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/DrinkOrder"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/IngredientOrder"
      discriminator:
        propertyName: orderType
```

In the previous example, the value of the `orderType` property will determine the order type. The value of `orderType` must match one of the schema components, so must be either `DrinkOrder` or `IngredientOrder`.

To use values that don't match a schema key, a discriminator object can include a `mapping` property that maps values to schemas. Here's an example:

```yaml
components:
  responses:
    OrderResponse:
      oneOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/DrinkOrder"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/IngredientOrder"
      discriminator:
        propertyName: orderType
        mapping:
          drink: "#/components/schemas/DrinkOrder"
          ingredient: "#/components/schemas/IngredientOrder"
```
