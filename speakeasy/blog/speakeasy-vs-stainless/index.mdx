<div className="Callout" data-title="NOTE" data-variant="info">
  This comparison of Speakeasy & Stainless is based on a snapshot of two developing companies as of January 2025. If you think we need to update this post, please let us know!
</div>

In this post, we'll compare generated SDKs, as well as the underlying philosophies that guide the development of the two companies. And while we acknowledge that our views may be biased, we'll show our work along with our conclusions so that readers can decide for themselves.

## In short: How is Speakeasy different?

### OpenAPI-native vs OpenAPI-compatible

Speakeasy is OpenAPI-native; Stainless is OpenAPI-compatible. Stainless is built on a custom DSL known as the [Stainless config](https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/reference/config). This approach requires your team to manage an additional config file. Speakeasy has no intermediary DSL. Your OpenAPI spec is the only source of truth for SDK generation.

Being OpenAPI-native is beneficial for integration into an existing stack. Regardless of the API proxies, server-side code, or specific web framework that you're using, you can plug in Speakeasy's tools. Stainless is doubling down on a vertically integrated approach by building a [backend TypeScript framework](https://github.com/stainless-api/stl-api) which will become the foundation for their solution. Their product will work best when you buy the entire stack, Speakeasy will shine regardless of the other tools in your existing stack.

### Type-safe vs type-faith

There's [more on this topic](#runtime-type-checking) in the technical deep dive below. Speakeasy SDKs guarantee true end-to-end type safety, meaning that types are generated to validate both request and response objects defined in your API. Stainless SDKs, on the other hand, are mainly type-hinted, not guarding the API from bad inputs.

### Velocity and maturity

[Stainless was founded in 2021](https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/stainless/) and has expanded its language support to seven languages. By comparison, Speakeasy launched in October 2022 and has released support for ten languages in less time. The Speakeasy platform is also broader, with support for additional generation features, like [webhooks](/post/release-webhooks-support), [React Hooks](/post/release-react-hooks), and [contract testing](/post/release-contract-testing), not supported by Stainless.

Both companies are financially secure, having raised $25M+ in funding.

## Speakeasy vs Stainless: TypeScript SDK comparison

<div className="Callout" data-title="NOTE" data-variant="info">
  For this technical comparison, we'll create SDKs with Speakeasy and Stainless using an example bookstore API. You can find the complete OpenAPI document in this [example repository](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy-stainless-comparison).
</div>

## SDK structure


### Speakeasy


### Stainless

Speakeasy maintains a clear separation of concerns. There are separate folders for models and operations, both in the documentation and in the source folder, and distinct files for each component and operation.

Stainless generates an SDK that, at a glance, looks less organized, considering the greater number of configuration files at the root of the project, no separation of models and operations, and more shims scattered throughout.

Structure might seem superficial at first, but keep in mind that SDK users form their first impressions of your SDK from the same high-level overview. Some of this may be a matter of opinion, but at Speakeasy, we aim to generate SDKs that are as organized as SDKs coded by hand.

## Generated types and type safety

Both Speakeasy and Stainless generate TypeScript types, enabling developers to see errors and hints during development. However, Stainless does not generate types for complex OpenAPI component schemas.

For example, consider the following `Author` component from our OpenAPI document.

```yaml openapi.yaml mark=15:21
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 476:501
```

The highlighted `anyOf` list is of particular interest. This list states that a valid `Author` object must have a `name` or an `id`, or both. An author with neither a `name` nor an `id` should not validate against this schema.

Let's take a look at the relevant types generated by each SDK generator:

<div className="md:flex gap-10">
  <div className="md:w-1/2">
    ```typescript speakeasy/author.ts
    // ...
    export type AuthorWithID = {
        // !mark
        // !callout[/:/] Only id is required
        id: number; 
        name?: string | undefined;
        photo?: string | undefined;
        biography?: string | undefined;
    };

    export type AuthorWithName = {
        id?: number | undefined;
        // !mark
        // !callout[/:/] Only name is required
        name: string;
        photo?: string | undefined;
        biography?: string | undefined;
    };

    // !mark
    export type Author = AuthorWithName | AuthorWithID;
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="md:w-1/2">
    ```typescript stainless/books.ts
    // ...
    export namespace FantasyBook {
      export interface Author {
        // !mark
        // !callout[/:/] Both id and name are optional
        id?: number;
        biography?: string;
        // !mark
        // !callout[/:/] Both id and name are optional
        name?: string;
        photo?: string;
      }
    }

    // Repeated for ProgrammingBook and SciFiBook
    ```
  </div>
</div>

Here, we see that Speakeasy generates three types for the `Author` schema: `AuthorWithID`, `AuthorWithName`, and a union of these, called `Author`. 

The equivalent type generated by Stainless is an `Author` interface for each book type, with both `id` and `name` marked as optional.

As a result, the following example code using the Stainless SDK will incorrectly compile without any warnings. The equivalent Speakeasy code will correctly catch the compilation error:

<div className="md:flex gap-10">
  <div className="md:w-1/2">
    ```typescript speakeasy-example.ts
    // techbooks-speakeasy SDK created by Speakeasy
    import { TechBooks } from "techbooks-speakeasy";

    const bookStore = new TechBooks({
      apiKey: "123",
    });

    async function run() {
      await bookStore.books.addBook({
        // !mark
        // !callout[/}/] Compilation error: Type '{}' is not assignable to type 'Author'.
        author: {},
        category: "Programming",
        description: "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
        price: 2999,
        title: "Clean Code",
      });
    }

    run();
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="md:w-1/2">

    ```typescript stainless-example.ts
    // techbooks SDK generated by Stainless
    import { Techbooks } from "techbooks";

    const bookStore = new Techbooks({
      apiKey: "My API Key",
      clientId: "My Client ID",
      clientSecret: "My Client Secret",
    });

    async function run() {
      const params: Techbooks.BookCreateParams = {
        // !mark
        // !callout[/}/] No compilation error, even though the author object is empty
        author: {},
        category: "Programming",
        description: "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
        price: 2999,
        title: "Clean Code",
      };

      const result: Techbooks.BookCreateResponse = await bookStore.books.create(
        params
      );
    }

    run();
    ```
  </div>
</div>

### Runtime type checking

This brings us to the next type error that should be caught: runtime type errors. Speakeasy creates SDKs that are type-safe from development to production. As our CEO wrote, [type safe is better than type faith](/post/type-safe-vs-type-faith).

The SDK generated by Speakeasy uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the data sent to and received from the server. This provides safer runtime code execution and helps developers who use your SDK to receive early feedback about the data their app is sending. Furthermore, data validation on the client side gives users more confidence in your API's reliability by reducing the opportunity for unintended behavior caused by unexpected data.

To see how this works, let's look at what happens when the `price` field (an `integer` in the `Book` type from our example) is populated with a `float` value:

```yaml mark=18:21
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 379:406
```

```typescript speakeasy-example.ts
// techbooks-speakeasy SDK created by Speakeasy
import { TechBooks } from "techbooks-speakeasy";

const bookStore = new TechBooks({
  apiKey: "123",
});

async function run() {
  await bookStore.books.addBook({
    author: {
      name: "Robert C. Martin",
      photo: "https://example.com/photos/robert.jpg",
      biography: 'Robert Cecil Martin, colloquially known as "Uncle Bob", is an American software engineer...',
    },
    category: "Programming",
    description: "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
    // !mark
    // !callout[/:/] Validation error: Expected integer, received float
    price: 29.99,
    title: "Clean Code",
  });
}

run();
```

The `price` field in the `Book` object in our test code is set to `29.99`, which is a floating-point number. This will trigger a Zod validation error before the data is sent to the server, as the `price` field is expected to be an integer. [Handling Zod validation errors](https://zod.dev/?id=error-handling) is straightforward, and allows users to get fast feedback on where they are going wrong.

The same book object in code using the Stainless-generated SDK will only be validated on the server. This means that the error will only be caught from the client's perspective _after_ the data is sent to the server, and the server responds with an error message. If the server is not set up to validate the `price` field, the error will _not be caught at all_, leading to unexpected behavior in your users' applications.

As a result, developers using the SDK generated by Stainless may need to write additional client-side validation code to catch these errors before they are sent to the server.

## OAuth client credentials handling

Both Speakeasy and Stainless generate SDKs that handle OAuth 2.0 with client credentials. However, only Speakeasy's SDKs handle the token lifecycle, retries, and error handling without any additional code.

Our bookstore API requires an OAuth 2.0 token with client credentials to access the API. Let's see how the SDKs handle this.

Consider the following OAuth 2.0 configuration from our OpenAPI document:

```yaml openapi.yaml
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 633:639
```

Speakeasy's generated SDK takes a `clientID` and `clientSecret` when instantiating the SDK. The SDK also includes `ClientCredentialsHook` class that implements `BeforeRequestHook` to check whether the token is expired and refresh it if necessary. The hook also checks whether the client has the necessary scopes to access the endpoint, and handles authentication errors.

<div className="md:flex gap-10">
  <div className="md:w-1/2">
    ```typescript speakeasy-example/addbook.ts
    import { TechBooks } from "techbooks-speakeasy";
    
    const bookStore = new TechBooks({
      security: {
        // !mark(1:3)
        // OAuth 2.0 client credentials
        clientID: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>",
        clientSecret: "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>",
        },
      });
      
    async function run() {
    // !mark
    // The SDK handles the token lifecycle, retries, and error handling for you
      await bookStore.books.addBook({
        // Book object
      });
    }

    run();
  ```
  </div>


  <div className="md:w-1/2">
    ```typescript stainless-example/addbook.ts
    import TechBooks from 'stainless-book-sdk';
    import axios from 'axios';

    const clientId = '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>';
    const clientSecret = '<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>';

    async function getOAuthToken() {
      const response = await axios.post('https://api.bookstore.com/oauth/token', {
        grant_type: 'client_credentials',
        client_id: clientId,
        client_secret: clientSecret
      });
      return response.data.access_token;
    }

    const client = new TechBooks({
      retries: {
        maxRetries: 3
        }
    });

    async function run() {
      // !mark(1:2)
      // Need to manually fetch and manage token
      const token = await getOAuthToken();
      client.defaultHeaders = {
        // !mark
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      };

      await client.books.addBook({
        // Book object
      });
    }

    run();
    ```
  </div>
</div>

The SDK generated by Stainless requires you to manually fetch and manage the OAuth token. This means that you'll need to write additional code to handle the token lifecycle, retries, and error handling. You'll also need to include additional configuration in the Stainless configuration file to use Bearer tokens.

```yaml stainless-config.yaml
client_settings:
  opts:
    access_token:
      type: string
      auth:
        security_scheme: BearerAuth
      read_env: MY_TEAM_ACCESS_TOKEN

security:
  - BearerAuth: []

security_schemes:
  BearerAuth:
    type: http
    scheme: bearer
```

Speakeasy does not require any additional configuration to handle OAuth 2.0 with client credentials. The SDK itself handles the token lifecycle, retries, and error handling.

## Webhooks support

Webhooks enable users to receive real-time updates from your API through HTTP callbacks in your SDK. Speakeasy and Stainless both generate SDKs that support webhooks, but Speakeasy's SDKs provide built-in support for webhook validation, payload parsing, and delivery.

Stainless doesn't provide out-of-the-box functionality for handling webhooks. You must implement your own logic for verifying event signatures, such as HMAC or RSA, defining event payload types, and managing retry mechanisms.

The example below shows how the `techbooks-speakeasy` SDK can validate and parse a `book.created` event, as well as the corresponding OpenAPI spec defining the webhook event.

<div className="md:flex gap-10">
  <div className="md:w-1/2">
    ```typescript speakeasy-example/webhook.ts
    // techbooks-speakeasy SDK created by Speakeasy
    import { TechBooks } from "techbooks-speakeasy";

    const bookStore = new TechBooks();

    async function handleWebhook(request: Request) {
      const secret = "my-webhook-secret";

      const res = await bookStore.webhooks.validateWebhook({ request, secret }); 

      if (res.error) {
        console.error("Webhook validation failed:", res.error);
        throw new Error("Invalid webhook signature");
      }

      // `res.data` is strongly typed based on your OpenAPI spec
      const { data, inferredType } = res;

      switch (data.type) {
        case "book.created":
          console.log("New Book Created:", data.title);
          // ...
          break;
        case "book.deleted":
          console.log("Book Deleted:", data.title);
          // ...
          break;
        default:
          console.warn(`Unhandled event type: ${inferredType}`);
      }
    }
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="md:w-1/2">

  ```yaml openapi.yaml
  # !focus(4:33)
  openapi: 3.1.1

                properties:
                  id:
                    type: string
                  title:
                    type: string
                required:

    ...
  ```
  </div>
</div>
      
You can read more about how Speakeasy handles webhooks in our [webhooks release post](/post/release-webhooks-support).

## React Hooks

React Hooks simplify state and data management in React apps, enabling developers to consume APIs more efficiently. Speakeasy generates built-in React Hooks using [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). These hooks provide features like intelligent caching, type safety, pagination, and integration with modern React patterns like SSR and Suspense. Stainless does not generate React Hooks. 

```tsx speakeasy-example/booksView.tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

function BookShelf() { // loads books from an API
  const { data, status, error } = useQuery([
    "books" // Cache key for the query
  ], async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/books");
    return response.json();
  });

  if (status === "loading") return <span className="p">Loading books...</span>;
  if (status === "error") return <span className="p">Error: {error?.message}</span>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((book) => (
        <li key={book.id}>{book.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

For example, in this basic implementation, the `useQuery` hook fetches data from an API endpoint. The cache key ensures unique identification of the query. The `status` variable provides the current state of the query: `loading`, `error`, or `success`. Depending on the query status, the component renders `loading`, `error`, or the fetched data as a list.

For an in-depth look at how Speakeasy uses React Hooks, see our [official release article](/post/release-react-hooks).

## Summary

We've all experienced bad SDKs that make integration with the API harder, not easier. Speakeasy is building a generator to make poorly written, poorly maintained SDKs a thing of the past. To do so, our team has put an extraordinary level of thought into getting the details of SDK generation right. We think that the effort has earned us the position to compare favorably with any other generator.
