# Automated Test Generation

Automatically generate tests for your API and SDKs. Speakeasy can generate tests for all your operations including any new operations added in the future.

These tests use any examples available in your OpenAPI document if available, or autogenerate examples based on the field name, type, and format of your schemas.

Multiple tests per operation can be configured using the named examples detailed for your parameters, request bodies and responses.

Tests are generated to a `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file in your SDK repo which then can be modified to customize the autogenerated tests if desired.

## Prerequisites

The following are requirements for generating tests:

- [Testing feature prerequisites](/docs/testing#prerequisites) are met.

## Enabling Test Generation

Enable test generation in your SDK by modifying the SDK generation configuration (typically `.speakeasy/gen.yaml`).

<div className="ScrollyCoding">

### !!steps `generation`

Enable test generation and mock API server generation by adding to the `generation` section of the configuration.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(2)
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ... other existing configuration ...
  tests:
    generateNewTests: true
```

---

### !!steps `tests`

Enable automated generation of tests for new operations found.
When enabling for the first time this will generate tests for all operations in your OpenAPI document.
Then going forward it will only generate tests for any operations not already found in your `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(4:5)
```

---

</div>

After enabling test generation, if you wish to disable generation of tests for a specific operation, you can explicitly set `x-speakeasy-test: false`:

```yaml
paths:
  /example1:
    get:
      # This operation, without being explicitly disabled, will generate testing.
      # ... operation configuration ...
  /example2:
    get:
      # This operation will not generate testing.
      # ... other operation configuration ...
      x-speakeasy-test: false
```

### Generated Test Location

Generated test files are written in language-specific locations, relative to the root of the SDK:

| Language | Location |
|---|---|
| Go | `tests/` |
| Python | `tests/` |
| TypeScript | `src/__tests__` |

If the mock server is also generated, its output will be in a `mockserver` directory under these locations.

## Running Tests

Run testing, via any of these options, depends on your desired use case:

- Directly via the [`speakeasy test`](/docs/speakeasy-reference/cli/test) CLI command.
- In [GitHub Actions workflows](/docs/customize-testing/github-actions).
- In the [`speakeasy run`](/docs/speakeasy-reference/cli/run) CLI command and existing GitHub Actions generation workflow with additional Speakeasy workflow configuration.

For `speakeasy run` support, modify the Speakeasy workflow configuration (`.speakeasy/workflow.yaml`).

<div className="ScrollyCoding">

### !!steps `targets`

Enable running tests during Speakeasy workflows by adding to one or more of the targets in the  `targets` section of the configuration.

```yaml ! workflow.yaml
# !focus(1)
targets:
  example-target:
    # ... other existing configuration ...
    testing:
      enabled: true
```

---

### !!steps `testing`

Enable testing for the target.

```yaml ! workflow.yaml
# !focus(4:5)
targets:
  example-target:
    # ... other existing configuration ...
    testing:
      enabled: true
```

---

</div>

### Data Handling

The definition of each operation will determine what data is used in generated testing. In addition to the [data type system](/openapi/schemas/dataTypes) shaping data, OpenAPI Specification supports [examples](/openapi/examples). Test generation will automatically use defined examples when available. In the absense of defined examples, the test generation will attempt to use a realistic example based on the `type`, `format` (if set), and property name (if applicable).

#### Example Property

By default, a single test will be created based on any `example` properties found throughout any defined operation `parameters`, `requestBody`, and `responses`.

In this example, a single test is created for the `updatePet` operation with `id`, `name`, and `photoUrls` data:

<div className="ScrollyCoding">

### !!steps `paths[/pet].put.operationId`

This test is created for the `updatePet` operation.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(8)
paths:
  "/pet":
    put:
      tags:
      - pet
      summary: Update an existing pet
      description: Update an existing pet by Id
      operationId: updatePet
      requestBody:
        description: Update an existent pet in the store
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
        required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      required:
      - name
      - photoUrls
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
          example: 10
        name:
          type: string
          example: doggie
        category:
          "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Category"
        photoUrls:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
        tags:
          type: array
          items:
            "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Tag"
        status:
          type: string
          description: pet status in the store
          enum:
          - available
          - pending
          - sold
```

---

### !!steps `paths[/pet].put.requestBody`

The operation uses the `Pet` shared component for both the request body and response.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(9,14,16,22)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.required`

The `Pet` shared component is an object type with required `name` and `photoUrls` properties.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(25:29)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.id`

While not required, the `Pet` object `id` property has an `example` property, which will be automatically included in the test.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(31,34)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.name`

The required `Pet` object `name` property has an `example` property, which will be included in the test.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(35,37)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.photoUrls`

The required `Pet` object `photoUrls` property does not include an `example` property, however it will have an example value automatically created since it is required.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(40:43)
```

---

</div>

This definition creates a test with `Pet` object request body and response data:

```yaml
id: 10
name: doggie
photoUrls:
  - <value>
```

#### Examples Property

Define multiple tests for an operation using the `examples` property, which in this context is a mapping of example name string keys to example values. Prevent missing or mismatched test generation by ensuring the same example name key is used across all necessary `parameters`, `requestBody`, and `responses` parts of the operation. If desired, [define reusable examples under components](/openapi/examples) similar to schemas.

In this example, multiple tests (`fido` and `rover`) are created for the `addPet` operation:

<div className="ScrollyCoding">

### !!steps `paths[/pet].post.operationId`

These tests are created for the `addPet` operation.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(8)
paths:
  "/pet":
    post:
      tags:
      - pet
      summary: Add a new pet to the store
      description: Add a new pet to the store
      operationId: addPet
      requestBody:
        description: Create a new pet in the store
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
            examples:
              fido:
                summary: fido request
                description: fido example requestBody for test generation
                value:
                  name: Fido
                  photoUrls:
                    - https://www.example.com/fido.jpg
                  status: available
              rover:
                summary: rover request
                description: rover example requestBody for test generation
                value:
                  name: Rover
                  photoUrls:
                    - https://www.example.com/rover1.jpg
                    - https://www.example.com/rover2.jpg
                  status: pending
        required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
              examples:
                fido:
                  summary: fido response
                  description: fido example response for test generation
                  value:
                    id: 1
                    name: Fido
                    photoUrls:
                      - https://www.example.com/fido.jpg
                    status: available
                rover:
                  summary: rover response
                  description: rover example response for test generation
                  value:
                    id: 2
                    name: Rover
                    photoUrls:
                      - https://www.example.com/rover1.jpg
                      - https://www.example.com/rover2.jpg
                    status: pending
```

---

### !!steps `paths[/pet].post.requestBody`

This operation includes both request body and response examples.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(9,15,34,41)
```

---

### !!steps `examples.fido`

An `addPet` operation `fido` test is created with example request body and response data.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(16:23,42:50)
```

---

### !!steps `examples.rover`

An `addPet` operation `rover` test is created with example request body and response data.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(24:32,51:60)
```

---

</div>

#### Ignoring Data

Data properties can be explicitly ignored in testing via the `x-speakeasy-test-ignore` annotation.

In this example, the `other` property will be omitted from test generation:

```yaml
paths:
  /example:
    get:
      # ... other operation configuration ...
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  data:
                    type: string
                  other:
                    type: string
                    x-speakeasy-test-ignore: true
```
