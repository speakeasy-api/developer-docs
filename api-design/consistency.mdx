# Enforcing API consistency with a large team

In large organizations where multiple teams contribute to an API ecosystem,
maintaining consistency can be a challenge. Without some sort of defined
strategy, APIs may diverge in their style, error handling, naming conventions,
security practices, or even call the same thing different names. 

All of this causes confusion for users of the API, and this confusion costs time
and money as support staff need to answer questions, profitable integrations are
delayed, or breakages occur due to inconsistent behavior.

To ensure uniformity, organizations need a combination of structured guidelines,
automated enforcement, centralized API gateways, and thorough review processes.

## Define an API style guide

As 100 developers how to do something and you'll get 101 answers on the best way
to do it, and this can become a real headache when building APIs.

Instead of picking unique approaches to everything, and API style guide can be
written as a foundation for standardization, ensuring that all teams follow a
common approach when designing and building APIs. 

A good guide should clearly define naming conventions for endpoints, query
parameters, and request/response properties, and require establish standards for
structured things like [pagination](/api-design/pagination), [error
handling](/api-design/errors), [collections](/api-design/collections), and
[HTTP status codes](/api-design/status-codes).

Authentication and security guidelines must be outlined, covering mechanisms
like OAuth, API keys, and rate limiting, all of which should work the same
across APIs wherever possible to allow code reuse and reduce the cognitive load.

Additionally, the guide should include a versioning strategy to manage changes
effectively and set documentation standards for OpenAPI descriptions to ensure
completeness and clarity.

These style guides are living documents that should be updated regularly to
reflect changes in best practices and organizational requirements, and can be
published internally or publicly to help other organizations who might like your
style. Lots of companies have done this, including
[Google](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design), and many more which can be found
[here](https://apistylebook.com/design/guidelines/).

## Automated style guides

Writing all these decisions down is a good start, but it's not enough. Humans
make mistakes, misread things, and misremember things. As guides evolve and new
advice is added, people are unlikely to come back and read the guide again and
might not spot the new advice.

API linting tools exist to help, with two popular tools being Spectral, vacuum,
and the Speakeasy CLI. This will not only validate OpenAPI
documents to make sure they're syntactically correct, but can also be programmed to 
enforce the advice set out in the style guide.

This means that teams who have built an API can check it's ok before deploying
it to production, and teams who are following the API design-first workflow can
get real-time feedback on the API as it is still being defined, further saving
time and money from being wasted coding something problematic. 

Spectral, vacuum and Speakeasy all automate a big chunk of the API style guide, making 
API design reviews considerably easier, letting the review focus on more complex
issues like "is this the right way to solve the problem?" rather than "is this
the right way to capitalize a property?".

Having all APIs following the same automated style guide, all integrated into
OpenAPI editors, code editors, and run again in CI/CD pipelines, teams can
be certain that APIs are going to be consistent, and only get better over time.

## Leveraging API gateways for centralized functionality

One way to remove discrepancies between APIs is to not have multiple APIs doing
the same thing in the first place. 

API gateways like [Kong](https://konghq.com/), [Tyk](https://tyk.io/), [Express
Gateway](https://www.express-gateway.io/), and [AWS API
Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) play a crucial role in
standardizing authentication and authorization policies, rate-limiting, traffic
filtering, and network caching. 

Leaving these features to be implemented in multiple APIs can be tricky even
when installing the same libraries. For example, while OAuth 2 is a standard and
should be implemented the same way regardless of the software, two different
APIs might be using two different versions of the Ruby on Rails OAuth 2 server
Doorkeeper, and one might have fixed a bug that the other hasn't. Those two will
vary again from another implementation written in another framework or another
language. 

They also help maintain uniform logging and monitoring practices by centralizing
API usage tracking and performance metrics. Additionally, gateways can
facilitate request and response transformations, ensuring backward compatibility
without requiring changes across multiple services. This is a helpful way to
remove inconsistencies from APIs which are already in production without
complicating the codebase.

## API design reviews

The API Design Review is a core component of a broader API governance program,
where stakeholders evaluate proposed API changes to ensure they align with the
organization's architecture and ecosystem. This process typically involves a
diverse group, including API designers, developers, technical writers, system
architects, and governance teams, all working together to maintain consistency
and quality across the API ecosystem

Just like code reviews are now common on pull requests, design reviews allow API
designers and developers to submit OpenAPI-based proposals for review either
before any code is written, or at the same time as code is written.

A dedicated review committee, including API architects and experienced
developers, should evaluate proposals based on adherence to guidelines and best
practices. 

The automated checks can be run with linting on these pull requests before
manual reviews to catch common issues efficiently, then design review meetings
provide a platform to further discuss key API decisions, trade-offs, and
potential improvements. This catches all the things a linter cannot, like "is
this the right name for this concept" or "this was just added to another API,
can we reuse that?"

## Summary

Achieving consistency across an API ecosystem in a large organization requires a
combination of well-documented style guides, automated enforcement through
linting, centralized functionality via API gateways, and a structured API design
review process.

Implementing all or some of these approaches should ensure that APIs remain
scalable, maintainable, and high quality, providing a surprise-free experience for
API consumers and hopefully making life easier for API producers as well.
