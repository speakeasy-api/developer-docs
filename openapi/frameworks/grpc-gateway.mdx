# How to generate an OpenAPI/Swagger spec with gRPC Gateway

You may want to provide a RESTful API in addition to your gRPC service without the need to duplicate your code.

[gRPC Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) is a popular tool for generating RESTful APIs from gRPC service definitions.

In this tutorial, we'll take a detailed look at how to use gRPC Gateway to generate an OpenAPI schema based on a Protocol Buffers (protobuf) gRPC service definition. Afterward, we can use Speakeasy to read our generated OpenAPI schema and create a production-ready SDK.

## An Overview of gRPC Gateway

[gRPC Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) is a [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) plugin that reads gRPC service definitions and generates a reverse proxy server that translates a RESTful JSON API into gRPC.

This way, you can expose an HTTP endpoint that can be called by clients that don't support gRPC. The generated server code will forward incoming JSON requests to your gRPC server and translate the responses to JSON.

gRPC Gateway also generates an OpenAPI schema that describes your API. You can use this schema to create SDKs for your API.

## OpenAPI Versions

gRPC Gateway outputs OpenAPI 2.0, and Speakeasy supports OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1. To generate an OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1 schema, you'll need to convert the OpenAPI 2.0 schema to at least OpenAPI 3.0.

## The Protobuf to REST SDK Pipeline

To generate a REST API with a developer-friendly SDK, we'll follow these three core steps:

1. **gRPC to OpenAPI:** First, we will use gRPC Gateway to produce an OpenAPI schema based on our protobuf service definition. This generated schema is in OpenAPI 2.0 format.

2. **OpenAPI 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.x:** Next, as gRPC Gateway's output schema is in OpenAPI 2.0 and we need at least OpenAPI 3.0 for our SDK, we will convert the generated schema from OpenAPI 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0.

3. **OpenAPI 3.x to SDK:** Finally, once we have the OpenAPI 3.0 schema, we will leverage Speakeasy to create our SDK based on the OpenAPI 3.0 schema derived from the previous steps.

By following these steps, we can ensure we have a robust, production-ready SDK that adheres to our API's specifications.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: From Protobuf to OpenAPI to an SDK

Now let's walk through generating an OpenAPI schema and SDK for our Speakeasy Bar gRPC service.

### Check Out the Example Repository

If you would like to follow along, start by cloning the example repository:

```bash Terminal
git clone git@github.com:speakeasy-api/speakeasy-grpc-gateway-example.git
cd speakeasy-grpc-gateway-example
```

### Install Go

To generate an OpenAPI schema from a protobuf file, we'll need to install Go and protoc.

This tutorial was written using Go 1.21.4.

On macOS, install Go by running:

```bash Terminal
brew install go
```

Alternatively, follow the [Go installation instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install) for your platform.

### Install Buf

We'll use the [Buf CLI](https://buf.build/) as an alternative to protoc so that we can save our generation configuration as YAML. Buf is compatible with protoc plugins.

On macOS, install Buf by running:

```bash Terminal
brew install bufbuild/buf/buf
```

Alternatively, follow the [Buf CLI installation instructions](https://buf.build/docs/installation) for your platform.

### Install Buf Modules

We'll use Buf modules to manage our dependencies.

```bash Terminal
cd proto
buf mod update
cd ..
```

### Install protoc-gen-go

Buf requires the `protoc-gen-go` plugin to generate Go code from protobuf files.

Install `protoc-gen-go` by running:

```bash Terminal
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```

Make sure that the `protoc-gen-go` binary is in your `$PATH`. On macOS, you can achieve that by running the following command if the `go/bin` directory is not already in your path.

```bash Terminal
export PATH=${PATH}:`go env GOPATH`/bin
```

### Install Go Requirements

```bash Terminal
go mod tidy
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

### Generate the Go Code

We'll use Buf to generate the Go code from the protobuf file.

Run the following in the terminal:

```bash Terminal
buf generate
```

Buf reads the configuration in `buf.gen.yaml`, then generates the Go code in the `proto` directory.

This will generate the `proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.pb.go`, `proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy_grpc.pb.go`, and `proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.pb.gw.go` files.

### Generate the OpenAPI Schema

Because we have the `openapiv2` protoc plugin configured in our `buf.gen.yaml` file, Buf will generate an OpenAPI schema and save it as `openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.swagger.json`.

This is the OpenAPI 2.0 schema that gRPC Gateway generates by default.

### Convert the OpenAPI Schema to OpenAPI 3.0

We'll use the excellent [kin-openapi](https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi) Go library to convert the OpenAPI 2.0 schema to OpenAPI 3.0.

In `convert/convert.go`, we use `kin-openapi` to unmarshal `openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.swagger.json`, then convert it to OpenAPI 3.0, then marshal it back to JSON, and finally write it to `openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json`.

To do the conversion, run the following in the terminal:

```bash Terminal
go run convert/convert.go
```

## How To Customize the API Schema

By modifying the protobuf service definition, we can customize the generated OpenAPI schema.

We'll start with a basic example and add options to enhance the schema.

<ScrollyCoding fullHeight>

## !!steps Meet the Speakeasy Bar Protobuf Service

We'll start by taking a look at the Speakeasy Bar protobuf service definition in `proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto`.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy-raw.proto
```

---

## !!steps

The service defines one object type, called `Drink`.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto
// !focus(9:32)
```

---

## !!steps

A service called `SpeakeasyService` has two methods, `GetDrink` and `ListDrinks`.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto
// !focus(42:59)
```

---

## !!steps Add API Information to the Service

We'll add information about the API to the service definition using `options.openapiv2_swagger` from `grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2`.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto
// !focus(10:26)
```

---

## !!steps

We'll add a title, description, and version to the API.


```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto
// !focus(11:15)
```

---

## !!steps

This appears in the `info` object in the generated OpenAPI schema.

```json !! openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json(generated)
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.openapi.json
```

---

## !!steps

We'll add a server to the API using the `host` key.

Our conversion script will add the `servers` object to the generated OpenAPI schema.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=16
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

## !!steps

Our conversion script will add the `servers` object to the generated OpenAPI schema.

```json !! openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json(generated) focus=222:226
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.openapi.json
```

---

## !!steps Add Descriptions and Examples to Components

To create an SDK that offers a great developer experience, we recommend adding descriptions and examples to all fields in OpenAPI components.

We'll start with the `Drink` object type.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=29:35
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

## !!steps

We added a `title`, `description`, and `example` to the `Drink` object type.

Note that the `example` is a stringified JSON object.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=29:35 mark=34
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

## !!steps

We use `openapiv2_field` to add options to the fields in the `Drink` object type.

For example, we added a `description`, `pattern`, format, and `example` to the `productCode` field.

```cpp !! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=74:79
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

```json !! openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json(generated) focus=66:72
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.openapi.json
```

---

## !!steps

If you use Speakeasy to create an SDK, this description and example will appear in the generated documentation and usage examples.

This usage example is from the TypeScript SDK's documentation.

Note how the `productCode` field is represented by our UUID example instead of a random string.

```typescript ! sdk/docs/sdks/drinks/README.md(generated)
// !mark(7)
import { SDK } from "openapi";

(async() => {
  const sdk = new SDK();

  const res = await sdk.drinks.getDrink({
    productCode: "602a7da9-b8bb-46e6-b288-457b561029b8",
  });

  if (res.statusCode == 200) {
    // handle response
  }
})();
```

---

## !!steps Customize the OperationId

By default, the `operationId` is the method name in the protobuf service definition.

We can customize the `operationId` for each method using `options.openapiv2_operation`.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=105
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

```json ! openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json(generated) focus=122
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.openapi.json
```

---

## !!steps Add Descriptions and Tags to Methods

We can add descriptions and tags to methods using `options.openapiv2_operation`.

```cpp !! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=106
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

```json !! openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json(generated) focus=219:226
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.openapi.json
```

---

## !!steps Add Tag Descriptions

We can add descriptions to tags in the protobuf definition by using `options.openapiv2_swagger`.

In the code example, we added a description to the `drinks` tag.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=22:25
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

```json ! openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json(generated) focus=221
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.openapi.json
```

---

## !!steps Add OpenAPI Extensions

gRPC Gateway allows us to add OpenAPI extensions to the OpenAPI schema using the `extensions` key in our protobuf service definition.

For example, we can add the [Speakeasy retries extension](/docs/customize-sdks/retries) `x-speakeasy-retries`, which will cause the SDK to retry failed requests.

In the code example, we added the `x-speakeasy-retries` extension to the `GetDrink` method.

```cpp ! proto/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.proto focus=120:179
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.proto
```

---

```json ! openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json(generated) focus=200:209
!from ./assets/grpc/speakeasy.openapi.json
```

</ScrollyCoding>

## Create an SDK With Speakeasy

Now that we have an OpenAPI 3.0 schema, we can create an SDK with Speakeasy. Speakeasy will create documentation and usage examples based on the descriptions and examples we added.

We'll use the `speakeasy quickstart` command to create an SDK for the Speakeasy Bar gRPC service.

Run the following in the terminal:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy quickstart
```

Follow the onscreen prompts to provide the necessary configuration details for your new SDK such as the name, schema location and output path. Enter `openapi/speakeasy/v1/speakeasy.openapi.json` when prompted for the OpenAPI document location and select TypeScript when prompted for which language you would like to generate.

## Example Protobuf Definition and SDK Generator

The source code for our complete example is available in the [**gRPC Speakeasy Bar example repository**](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy-grpc-gateway-example).

The repository contains a TypeScript SDK and instructions on how to create more SDKs.

You can clone this repository to test how changes to the protobuf definition result in changes to the SDK.

After modifying your protobuf definition, you can run the following in the terminal to create a new SDK:

```bash Terminal
buf generate && go run convert/convert.go && speakeasy quickstart
```

Happy generating!
