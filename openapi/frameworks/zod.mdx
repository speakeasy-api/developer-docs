# How to generate an OpenAPI document with Zod

Zod is a powerful and flexible schema validation library for TypeScript, which many developers use to define their TypeScript data parsing schemas.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use another TypeScript library, the `zod-openapi` npm package, to convert Zod schemas into a complete OpenAPI document, and then how to use Speakeasy to generate a production-ready SDK from that document.

## Why use Zod with OpenAPI?

Combining Zod with OpenAPI generation offers the best of both worlds: runtime validation and automatic API documentation. Instead of writing schemas twice – once for runtime validation and again for your OpenAPI document – you define your data models once in Zod and generate both TypeScript types and OpenAPI documentation from the same source.

This eliminates the task of keeping hand-written OpenAPI documents in sync with your actual API implementation. When paired with Speakeasy's SDK generation, you get type-safe client libraries that automatically stay up to date with your API changes.

<Callout title="Zod versions and other libaries" type="info">
This guide uses `zod-openapi`, which is actively maintained and offers better TypeScript integration than the older `zod-to-openapi` library.

We show how to use a dual import strategy, which means we use both Zod v3 and v4 in the same project. This approach is necessary because `zod-openapi` currently requires Zod v3 compatibility, but you may want to use Zod v4 features elsewhere in your application.

While Zod v4 introduces new features like `z.strictObject()` and `z.email()`, you'll need to use the standard Zod import for OpenAPI schemas and the `/v4` subpath for new features until `zod-openapi` adds full v4 support. Check the [zod-openapi releases](https://github.com/samchungy/zod-openapi/releases) for the latest compatibility updates.

Unlike most libraries, Zod is directly embedded in hundreds of other libraries' public APIs. A normal `zod@4.0.0` release would force every one of those libraries to publish breaking changes simultaneously - a massive "version avalanche".

The subpath approach (inspired by Go modules) lets libraries support both versions with one dependency, providing a gradual migration path for the entire ecosystem.

See [Colin's detailed explanation](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/4371) for the full technical reasoning.

## zod-openapi overview

The [`zod-openapi`](https://github.com/samchungy/zod-openapi) package is a TypeScript library that helps developers define OpenAPI schemas as Zod schemas. The stated goal of the project is to cut down on code duplication, and it does a wonderful job of this.

Zod schemas map well to OpenAPI schemas, and the changes required to extract OpenAPI documents from a schema defined in Zod are often small.

<Callout title="Migrating from zod-to-openapi?" type="info">
  If you're currently using the older `zod-to-openapi` library, the syntax will
  be familiar, and you can use either library. For migration guidance, see the
  [zod-openapi migration
  documentation](https://github.com/samchungy/zod-openapi#migration).
</Callout>

### Key concepts

Here's an overview of some key concepts in Zod and how they relate to Zod versioning.

#### Schemas and z.strictObject

Zod v4 introduces top-level helpers like `z.strictObject()` for objects that reject unknown keys and `z.email()` for email validation.

```typescript concept.ts
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { z as z4 } from "zod/v4";

// Use z4 for new Zod v4 features
const user = z4.strictObject({
  email: z4.email(),
  age: z4.number().int().min(18),
});
```

#### Field metadata

The `.openapi()` method adds OpenAPI-specific metadata like descriptions and examples to any Zod schema. Use `z3` for OpenAPI schemas.

```typescript concept.ts
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { extendZodWithOpenApi } from "zod-openapi";

extendZodWithOpenApi(z3);

const name = z3.string().min(1).openapi({
  description: "The user's full name",
  example: "Alice Johnson",
});
```

#### Operation objects

Use `ZodOpenApiOperationObject` to define API endpoints with request and response schemas.

```typescript concept.ts
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { ZodOpenApiOperationObject } from "zod-openapi";

const getUser: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "getUser",
  summary: "Get user by ID",
  requestParams: { path: z3.object({ id: z3.string() }) },
  responses: {
    "200": {
      description: "User found",
      content: { "application/json": { schema: userSchema } },
    },
  },
};
```

#### Adding tags to operations

Tags help organize your API operations in the generated documentation and SDKs. You can add a `tags` array to each operation object:

```typescript concept.ts
const getBurger: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "getBurger",
  summary: "Get a burger by ID",
  tags: ["burgers"], // <--- Add tags here
  // ...rest of the operation
};
```

#### Using Zod v4 features alongside OpenAPI documents

While your OpenAPI documents must use the `z3` instance for compatibility, you can use `z4` features for internal validation, type checking, or other parts of your application:

```typescript concept.ts
// OpenAPI-compatible schemas (use z3)
const apiUserSchema = z3
  .object({
    id: z3.string(),
    name: z3.string(),
    email: z3.string(),
  })
  .openapi("User");

// Internal schemas can use Zod v4 features (use z4)
const internalUserSchema = z4.strictObject({
  // v4 feature
  id: z4.string().uuid(),
  name: z4.string().min(1),
  email: z4.string().email(), // v4 feature
  preferences: z4
    .object({
      darkMode: z4.boolean(),
      notifications: z4.enum(["all", "mentions", "none"]),
    })
    .optional(),
});
```

## Step-by-step tutorial: From Zod to OpenAPI to an SDK

Now let's walk through the process of generating an OpenAPI document and SDK for our Burgers and Orders API.

### Requirements

This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with TypeScript and Node.js development.

The following should be installed on your machine:

- [Node.js version 18 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- The [Speakeasy CLI](/docs/introduction#install-the-speakeasy-cli), which we'll use to generate an SDK from the OpenAPI document

### Creating your Zod project

<Callout title="Complete Example Available" type="info">
  The source code for our complete example is available in the
  [`speakeasy-api/examples`](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/examples.git)
  repository in the `zod-openapi` directory. The project contains a
  pre-generated Python SDK with instructions on how to generate more SDKs. You
  can clone this repository to test how changes to the Zod schema definition
  result in changes to the generated SDK.
</Callout>

Alternatively, you can initialize a new npm project and install the required dependencies if you're not using our burgers example.

```
npm init -y
npm install zod@^3.25 zod-openapi yaml
```

If you're following along, start by cloning the `speakeasy-api/examples` repository.

```bash Terminal
git clone https://github.com/speakeasy-api/examples.git
cd zod-openapi
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash Terminal
npm install
```

### Installing TypeScript development tools

For this tutorial, we'll use `tsx` for running TypeScript directly:

```bash Terminal
npm install -D tsx
```

### Creating your app's first Zod schema

Save this TypeScript code in a new file called `index.ts`. Note the dual import strategy:

```typescript index.ts
// Import Zod v3 compatible instance for zod-openapi
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
// Import Zod v4 for new features and future migration
import { z as z4 } from "zod/v4";

// For now, we'll use z3 for OpenAPI schemas since zod-openapi requires it
const burgerSchema = z3.object({
  id: z3.number().min(1),
  name: z3.string().min(1).max(50),
  description: z3.string().max(255).optional(),
});
```

### Extending Zod with OpenAPI

We'll add the `openapi` method to Zod by calling `extendZodWithOpenApi` once. Update `index.ts` to import `extendZodWithOpenApi` from `zod-openapi`, then call `extendZodWithOpenApi` on the `z3` instance.

```typescript index.ts
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { extendZodWithOpenApi } from "zod-openapi";
import { z as z4 } from "zod/v4";

// Extend the Zod v3 compatible instance for zod-openapi
extendZodWithOpenApi(z3);

// Schemas defined with z3 for current zod-openapi compatibility
const burgerSchema = z3.object({
  id: z3.number().min(1),
  name: z3.string().min(1).max(50),
  description: z3.string().max(255).optional(),
});
```

### Registering and generating a component schema

Next, we'll use the new `openapi` method provided by `extendZodWithOpenApi` to register an OpenAPI schema for the `burgerSchema`. Edit `index.ts` and add `.openapi({ref: "Burger"}` to the `burgerSchema` schema object.

We'll also add an OpenAPI generator, `OpenApiGeneratorV31`, and log the generated component to the console as YAML.

```typescript index.ts
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { extendZodWithOpenApi } from "zod-openapi";
import { z as z4 } from "zod/v4";

extendZodWithOpenApi(z3);

const burgerSchema = z3.object({
  id: z3.number().min(1),
  name: z3.string().min(1).max(50),
  description: z3.string().max(255).optional(),
});

burgerSchema.openapi({ ref: "Burger" });
```

### Adding metadata to components

To generate an SDK that offers a great developer experience, we recommend adding descriptions and examples to all fields in OpenAPI components.

With `zod-openapi`, we'll call the `.openapi` method on each field, and add an example and description to each field.

We'll also add a description to the `Burger` component itself.

Edit `index.ts` and edit `burgerSchema` to add OpenAPI metadata.

```typescript index.ts
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { extendZodWithOpenApi } from "zod-openapi";
import { z as z4 } from "zod/v4";

extendZodWithOpenApi(z3);

const burgerSchema = z3.object({
  id: z3.number().min(1).openapi({
    description: "The unique identifier of the burger.",
    example: 1,
  }),
  name: z3.string().min(1).max(50).openapi({
    description: "The name of the burger.",
    example: "Veggie Burger",
  }),
  description: z3.string().max(255).optional().openapi({
    description: "The description of the burger.",
    example: "A delicious bean burger with avocado.",
  }),
});

burgerSchema.openapi({
  ref: "Burger",
  description: "A burger served at the restaurant.",
});
```

### Preparing to generate an OpenAPI document

Now that we know how to register components with metadata for our OpenAPI schema, let's generate a complete schema document.

Import `yaml` and `createDocument`.

```typescript index.ts
import * as yaml from "yaml";
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { createDocument, extendZodWithOpenApi } from "zod-openapi";
import { z as z4 } from "zod/v4";

extendZodWithOpenApi(z3);

const burgerSchema = z3.object({
  id: z3.number().min(1).openapi({
    description: "The unique identifier of the burger.",
    example: 1,
  }),
  name: z3.string().min(1).max(50).openapi({
    description: "The name of the burger.",
    example: "Veggie Burger",
  }),
  description: z3.string().max(255).optional().openapi({
    description: "The description of the burger.",
    example: "A delicious bean burger with avocado.",
  }),
});

burgerSchema.openapi({
  ref: "Burger",
  description: "A burger served at the restaurant.",
});
```

### Generating an OpenAPI document

We'll use the `createDocument` method to generate an OpenAPI document. We'll pass in the `burgerSchema` and a title for the document.

```typescript index.ts
import * as yaml from "yaml";
import { z as z3 } from "zod";
import { createDocument, extendZodWithOpenApi } from "zod-openapi";
import { z as z4 } from "zod/v4";

extendZodWithOpenApi(z3);

const burgerSchema = z3.object({
  id: z3.number().min(1).openapi({
    description: "The unique identifier of the burger.",
    example: 1,
  }),
  name: z3.string().min(1).max(50).openapi({
    description: "The name of the burger.",
    example: "Veggie Burger",
  }),
  description: z3.string().max(255).optional().openapi({
    description: "The description of the burger.",
    example: "A delicious bean burger with avocado.",
  }),
});

burgerSchema.openapi({
  ref: "Burger",
  description: "A burger served at the restaurant.",
});

const document = createDocument({
  openapi: "3.1.0",
  info: {
    title: "Burger Restaurant API",
    description: "An API for managing burgers and orders at a restaurant.",
    version: "1.0.0",
  },
  servers: [
    {
      url: "https://example.com",
      description: "The production server.",
    },
  ],
  components: {
    schemas: {
      burgerSchema,
    },
  },
});

console.log(yaml.stringify(document));
```

### Adding a burger ID schema

To make the burger ID available to other schemas, we'll define a burger ID schema. We'll also use this schema to define a path parameter for the burger ID later on.

```typescript index.ts
const BurgerIdSchema = z3
  .number()
  .min(1)
  .openapi({
    ref: "BurgerId",
    description: "The unique identifier of the burger.",
    example: 1,
    param: {
      in: "path",
      name: "id",
    },
  });
```

Update the `burgerSchema` to use the `BurgerIdSchema`.

```typescript index.ts
const burgerSchema = z3.object({
  id: BurgerIdSchema,
  name: z3.string().min(1).max(50).openapi({
    description: "The name of the burger.",
    example: "Veggie Burger",
  }),
  description: z3.string().max(255).optional().openapi({
    description: "The description of the burger.",
    example: "A delicious bean burger with avocado.",
  }),
});
```

### Adding a schema for creating burgers

We'll add a schema for creating burgers that doesn't include an ID. We'll use this schema to define the request body for the create burger path.

```typescript index.ts
const burgerCreateSchema = burgerSchema.omit({ id: true }).openapi({
  ref: "BurgerCreate",
  description: "A burger to create.",
});
```

### Adding order schemas

To match the final OpenAPI output, let's add schemas and endpoints for orders.

```typescript index.ts
const OrderIdSchema = z3
  .number()
  .min(1)
  .openapi({
    ref: "OrderId",
    description: "The unique identifier of the order.",
    example: 1,
    param: {
      in: "path",
      name: "id",
    },
  });

const orderSchema = z3
  .object({
    id: OrderIdSchema,
    burger_ids: z3
      .array(BurgerIdSchema)
      .min(1)
      .openapi({
        description: "The burgers in the order.",
        example: [1, 2],
      }),
    time: z3.string().openapi({
      description: "The time the order was placed.",
      example: "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      format: "date-time",
    }),
    table: z3.number().min(1).openapi({
      description: "The table the order is for.",
      example: 1,
    }),
    status: z3.enum(["pending", "in_progress", "ready", "delivered"]).openapi({
      description: "The status of the order.",
      example: "pending",
    }),
    note: z3.string().optional().openapi({
      description: "A note for the order.",
      example: "No onions.",
    }),
  })
  .openapi({
    ref: "Order",
    description: "An order placed at the restaurant.",
  });

const orderCreateSchema = orderSchema.omit({ id: true }).openapi({
  ref: "OrderCreate",
  description: "An order to create.",
});
```

### Defining burger and order operations

Now, define the operations for creating and getting burgers and orders, and listing burgers:

```typescript index.ts
import { ZodOpenApiOperationObject } from "zod-openapi";

const createBurger: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "createBurger",
  summary: "Create a new burger",
  description: "Creates a new burger in the database.",
  tags: ["burgers"],
  requestBody: {
    description: "The burger to create.",
    content: {
      "application/json": {
        schema: burgerCreateSchema,
      },
    },
  },
  responses: {
    "201": {
      description: "The burger was created successfully.",
      content: {
        "application/json": {
          schema: burgerSchema,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

const getBurger: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "getBurger",
  summary: "Get a burger",
  description: "Gets a burger from the database.",
  tags: ["burgers"],
  requestParams: {
    path: z3.object({ id: BurgerIdSchema }),
  },
  responses: {
    "200": {
      description: "The burger was retrieved successfully.",
      content: {
        "application/json": {
          schema: burgerSchema,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

const listBurgers: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "listBurgers",
  summary: "List burgers",
  description: "Lists all burgers in the database.",
  tags: ["burgers"],
  responses: {
    "200": {
      description: "The burgers were retrieved successfully.",
      content: {
        "application/json": {
          schema: z3.array(burgerSchema),
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

const createOrder: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "createOrder",
  summary: "Create a new order",
  description: "Creates a new order in the database.",
  tags: ["orders"],
  requestBody: {
    description: "The order to create.",
    content: {
      "application/json": {
        schema: orderCreateSchema,
      },
    },
  },
  responses: {
    "201": {
      description: "The order was created successfully.",
      content: {
        "application/json": {
          schema: orderSchema,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

const getOrder: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "getOrder",
  summary: "Get an order",
  description: "Gets an order from the database.",
  tags: ["orders"],
  requestParams: {
    path: z3.object({ id: OrderIdSchema }),
  },
  responses: {
    "200": {
      description: "The order was retrieved successfully.",
      content: {
        "application/json": {
          schema: orderSchema,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Adding a webhook that runs when a burger is created

We'll add a webhook that runs when a burger is created. We'll use the `ZodOpenApiOperationObject` type to define the webhook.

```typescript index.ts
const createBurgerWebhook: ZodOpenApiOperationObject = {
  operationId: "createBurgerWebhook",
  summary: "New burger webhook",
  description: "A webhook that is called when a new burger is created.",
  tags: ["burgers"],
  requestBody: {
    description: "The burger that was created.",
    content: {
      "application/json": {
        schema: burgerSchema,
      },
    },
  },
  responses: {
    "200": {
      description: "The webhook was processed successfully.",
    },
  },
};
```

### Registering all paths, webhooks, and extensions

Now, register all schemas, paths, webhooks, and the `x-speakeasy-retries` extension:

```typescript index.ts
const document = createDocument({
  openapi: "3.1.0",
  info: {
    title: "Burger Restaurant API",
    description: "An API for managing burgers and orders at a restaurant.",
    version: "1.0.0",
  },
  servers: [
    {
      url: "https://example.com",
      description: "The production server.",
    },
  ],
  "x-speakeasy-retries": {
    strategy: "backoff",
    backoff: {
      initialInterval: 500,
      maxInterval: 60000,
      maxElapsedTime: 3600000,
      exponent: 1.5,
    },
    statusCodes: ["5XX"],
    retryConnectionErrors: true,
  },
  paths: {
    "/burgers": {
      post: createBurger,
      get: listBurgers,
    },
    "/burgers/{id}": {
      get: getBurger,
    },
    "/orders": {
      post: createOrder,
    },
    "/orders/{id}": {
      get: getOrder,
    },
  },
  webhooks: {
    "/burgers": {
      post: createBurgerWebhook,
    },
  },
  components: {
    schemas: {
      burgerSchema,
      burgerCreateSchema,
      BurgerIdSchema,
      orderSchema,
      orderCreateSchema,
      OrderIdSchema,
    },
  },
});

console.log(yaml.stringify(document));
```

Speakeasy will read the `x-speakeasy-*` extensions to configure the SDK. In this example, the `x-speakeasy-retries` extension will configure the SDK to retry failed requests. For more information on the available extensions, see the [extensions guide](/openapi/extensions).

### Generating the OpenAPI document

Run the `index.ts` file to generate the OpenAPI document.

```bash Terminal
npx tsx index.ts > openapi.yaml
```

The output will be a YAML file that looks like this:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Burger Restaurant API
  description: An API for managing burgers and orders at a restaurant.
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://example.com
    description: The production server.
x-speakeasy-retries:
  strategy: backoff
  backoff:
    initialInterval: 500
    maxInterval: 60000
    maxElapsedTime: 3600000
    exponent: 1.5
  statusCodes:
    - 5XX
  retryConnectionErrors: true
paths:
  /burgers:
    post:

        content:
          application/json:
            schema:

    get:
      operationId: listBurgers
      summary: List burgers
      description: Lists all burgers in the database.
      tags:
        - burgers
      responses:
        "200":
          description: The burgers were retrieved successfully.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/burgerSchema"
  /burgers/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: getBurger
      summary: Get a burger
      description: Gets a burger from the database.
      tags:
        - burgers
      parameters:

          description: The unique identifier of the burger.
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/BurgerId"
          required: true
      responses:
        "200":
          description: The burger was retrieved successfully.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:

  /orders:
    post:

      summary: Create a new order
      description: Creates a new order in the database.
      tags:
        - orders
      requestBody:
        description: The order to create.
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:

### Generating an SDK

With our OpenAPI document complete, we can now generate an SDK using the Speakeasy SDK generator.

#### Installing the Speakeasy CLI

First, install the Speakeasy CLI:

```bash Terminal
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install speakeasy-api/tap/speakeasy

# Using curl
curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh
```

#### Linting your OpenAPI document

Before generating SDKs, lint your OpenAPI document to catch common issues:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy lint openapi --schema openapi.yaml
```

#### Using AI to improve your OpenAPI document

The Speakeasy CLI now includes AI-powered suggestions to automatically improve your OpenAPI documents:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy suggest openapi.yaml
```

Follow the onscreen prompts to provide the necessary configuration details for your new SDK, such as the schema and output path.

Read the [Speakeasy Suggest](/docs/prep-openapi/maintenance) documentation for more information on how to use Speakeasy Suggest.

#### Generating your SDK

Now you can generate your SDK using the quickstart command:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy quickstart
```

Follow the onscreen prompts to provide the necessary configuration details for your new SDK, such as the name, schema location, and output path. Enter `openapi.yaml` (or your improved OpenAPI document if you used suggestions) when prompted for the OpenAPI document location, and select your preferred language when prompted.

## Using your generated SDK

Once you've generated your SDK, you can [publish](/docs/publish-sdk) it for use. For TypeScript, you can publish it as an npm package.

TypeScript SDKs generated with Speakeasy include an installable [Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](/docs/standalone-mcp/build-server) where the various SDK methods are exposed as tools that AI applications can invoke. Your SDK documentation includes instructions for installing the MCP server.

<Callout title="Production Readiness" type="warning">
  Note that the SDK is not ready for production use immediately after
  generation. To get it production-ready, follow the steps outlined in your
  Speakeasy workspace.
</Callout>

### Adding SDK generation to your CI/CD pipeline

The Speakeasy [`sdk-generation-action`](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action) repository provides workflows for integrating the Speakeasy CLI into CI/CD pipelines to automatically regenerate SDKs when your Zod schemas change.

You can set up Speakeasy to automatically push a new branch to your SDK repositories so that your engineers can review and merge the SDK changes.

For an overview of how to set up automation for your SDKs, see the Speakeasy [SDK workflow syntax reference](/docs/speakeasy-reference/workflow-file).

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to generate OpenAPI schemas from Zod and create client SDKs with Speakeasy.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your API is well-documented, easy to use, and offers a great developer experience.
