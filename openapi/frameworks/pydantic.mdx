# How to generate an OpenAPI/Swagger spec with Pydantic V2

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is considered by many API developers to be the best data validation library for Python, and with good reason. By defining an application's models in Pydantic, developers benefit from a vastly improved development experience, runtime data validation and serialization, and automatic OpenAPI schema generation.

However, many developers don't realize they can generate OpenAPI schemas from their Pydantic models, which they can then use to create SDKs, documentation, and server stubs.

In this guide, you'll learn how to create new Pydantic models, generate an OpenAPI schema from them, and use the generated schema to create an SDK for your API. We'll start with the simplest possible Pydantic model and gradually add more features to show how Pydantic models translate to OpenAPI schemas.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. Check your Python version by running the following command:

```bash Terminal
python --version
```

We use Python 3.12.4 in this guide, but any version of Python 3.8 or higher should work.

## Create a New Python Project

First, create a new Python project and install the Pydantic library:

```bash Terminal
# Create and open a new directory for the project
mkdir pydantic-openapi
cd pydantic-openapi

# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install the Required Libraries

We'll install Pydantic and PyYAML to generate and pretty-print the OpenAPI schema:

```bash Terminal
# Install the Pydantic library
pip install pydantic

# Install the PyYAML library for pretty-printing the OpenAPI schema
pip install pyyaml
```

## Pydantic to OpenAPI Schema Walkthrough

Let's follow a step-by-step process to generate an OpenAPI schema from a Pydantic model without any additional libraries.

### Define a Simple Pydantic Model

Create a new Python file called `models.py` and define a simple Pydantic model.

In this example, we define a Pydantic model called `Pet` with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `breed`. The `id` field is an integer, and the `name` and `breed` fields are strings.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str
```

### Generate JSON Schema for the Pydantic Model

Add a new function called `print_json_schema` to the `models.py` file that prints the JSON schema for the `Pet` model.

This function uses the `model_json_schema` method provided by Pydantic to generate the JSON schema, which Python then prints to the console as YAML. We use YAML for readability, but the output is still a valid JSON schema.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str


def print_json_schema():
    print(yaml.dump(Pet.model_json_schema()))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema()
```

Run `python models.py` to generate the JSON schema for the `Pet` model and print it as YAML:

```yaml
properties:
  breed:
    title: Breed
    type: string
  id:
    title: Id
    type: integer
  name:
    title: Name
    type: string
required:
  - id
  - name
  - breed
title: Pet
type: object
```

### Multiple Pydantic Models

Let's add another Pydantic model called `Owner` to the `models.py` file.

The `Owner` model has two fields: `id` and `name`. Both fields are integers. Additionally, the `Owner` model has a list of `Pet` objects.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str


class Owner(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    pets: list[Pet]


def print_json_schema():
    print(yaml.dump(Pet.model_json_schema()))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema()
```

### Generate JSON Schema for Multiple Pydantic Models

Update the `print_json_schema` function to print the JSON schema for both the `Pet` and `Owner` models.

Note that we're now calling the [`models_json_schema`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.7/api/json_schema/#pydantic.json_schema.models_json_schema) function from `pydantic.json_schema` instead of the `model_json_schema` method.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str


class Owner(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    pets: list[Pet]


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
    )
    print(yaml.dump(schemas))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

Run `python models.py` to generate the JSON schema for both the `Pet` and `Owner` models and print it as YAML:

```yaml
$defs:
  Owner:
    properties:
      id:
        title: Id
        type: integer
      name:
        title: Name
        type: string
      pets:
        items:
          $ref: "#/$defs/Pet"
        title: Pets
        type: array
    required:
      - id
      - name
      - pets
    title: Owner
    type: object
  Pet:
    properties:
      breed:
        title: Breed
        type: string
      id:
        title: Id
        type: integer
      name:
        title: Name
        type: string
    required:
      - id
      - name
      - breed
    title: Pet
    type: object
```

The generated schema includes definitions for both the `Pet` and `Owner` models. The `Owner` model has a reference to the `Pet` model, indicating that the `Owner` model contains a list of `Pet` objects.

Note that the root of the schema includes a `$defs` key that contains the definitions for both models, and the `Owner` model references the `Pet` model using the `$ref` keyword.

### Customize Pydantic JSON Schema Generation

Let's customize the generated JSON schema to reference the `Pet` model using the `#/components/schemas` path instead of `$defs`.

We'll use the `ref_template` parameter of the `models_json_schema` function to specify the reference template.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str


class Owner(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    pets: list[Pet]


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    print(yaml.dump(schemas))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

Next, we'll update the `print_json_schema` function to print a JSON schema that resembles an OpenAPI schema's `components` section.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str


class Owner(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    pets: list[Pet]


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    openapi_schema = {
        "components": {
            "schemas": schemas.get('$defs'),
        }
    }
    print(yaml.dump(openapi_schema))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

Run `python models.py` to generate the OpenAPI schema for both the `Pet` and `Owner` models.

The generated OpenAPI schema includes the `components` section, with definitions for both the `Pet` and `Owner` models.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Owner:
      properties:
        id:
          title: Id
          type: integer
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
        pets:
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
          title: Pets
          type: array
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - pets
      title: Owner
      type: object
    Pet:
      properties:
        breed:
          title: Breed
          type: string
        id:
          title: Id
          type: integer
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - breed
      title: Pet
      type: object
```

The JSON Schema we generated resembles an OpenAPI schema's `components` section, but to generate a valid OpenAPI schema, we need to add the `openapi` and `info` sections.

Edit the `print_json_schema` function in `models.py` to include the `openapi` and `info` sections in the generated OpenAPI schema.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str


class Owner(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    pets: list[Pet]


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    openapi_schema = {
        "openapi": "3.1.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Pet Sitter API",
            "version": "0.0.1",
        },
        "components": {
            "schemas": schemas.get('$defs'),
        }
    }
    print(yaml.dump(openapi_schema))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

Run `python models.py` to generate the complete OpenAPI schema for both the `Pet` and `Owner` models.

The generated OpenAPI schema includes the `openapi`, `info`, and `components` sections with definitions for both the `Pet` and `Owner` models.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Pet Sitter API
  version: 0.0.1
components:
  schemas:
    Owner:
      properties:
        id:
          title: Id
          type: integer
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
        pets:
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
          title: Pets
          type: array
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - pets
      title: Owner
      type: object
    Pet:
      properties:
        id:
          title: Id
          type: integer
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
        breed:
          title: Breed
          type: string
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - breed
      title: Pet
      type: object
```

Now we have a complete OpenAPI document that we can use to generate SDK clients for our API. However, the generated OpenAPI schema does not contain descriptions or example values for the models. We can add these details to the Pydantic models to improve the generated OpenAPI schema.

### Adding Descriptions to Pydantic Models

Let's add docstrings to the `Pet` and `Owner` models to include additional information in the generated OpenAPI schema.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    """
    A Pet in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple owners.
    """

    id: int
    name: str
    breed: str


class Owner(BaseModel):
    """
    An Owner of Pets in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple pets.
    """

    id: int
    name: str
    pets: list[Pet]


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    openapi_schema = {
        "openapi": "3.1.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Pet Sitter API",
            "version": "0.0.1",
        },
        "components": {
            "schemas": schemas.get("$defs"),
        },
    }
    print(yaml.dump(openapi_schema, sort_keys=False))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

If we run `python models.py`, we see that our `Owner` schema now includes a description field, derived from the docstring we added to the `Owner` Pydantic model.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Pet Sitter API
  version: 0.0.1
components:
  schemas:
    Owner:
      description: "An Owner of Pets in the system.


        ID is unique.

        Can have multiple pets."
      properties:
        id:
          title: Id
          type: integer
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
        pets:
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
          title: Pets
          type: array
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - pets
      title: Owner
      type: object
    Pet:
      description: "A Pet in the system.


        ID is unique.

        Can have multiple owners."
      properties:
        id:
          title: Id
          type: integer
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
        breed:
          title: Breed
          type: string
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - breed
      title: Pet
      type: object
```

The `Pet` schema now also includes a description field, derived from the docstring we added to the `Pet` Pydantic model.

### Adding OpenAPI Titles and Descriptions to Pydantic Fields

Let's add titles and descriptions to the fields of the `Pet` and `Owner` models to include additional information in the generated OpenAPI schema.

We'll use the `Field` class from Pydantic to add descriptions to the fields.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    """
    A Pet in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple owners.
    """

    id: int = Field(..., title="Pet ID", description="The pet's unique identifier")
    name: str = Field(..., title="Pet Name", description="Name of the pet")
    breed: str = Field(..., title="Pet Breed", description="Breed of the pet")


class Owner(BaseModel):
    """
    An Owner of Pets in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple pets.
    """

    id: int = Field(..., title="Owner ID", description="Owner's unique identifier")
    name: str = Field(..., title="Owner Name", description="The owner's full name")
    pets: list[Pet] = Field(
        ..., title="Owner's Pets", description="The pets that belong to this owner"
    )


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    openapi_schema = {
        "openapi": "3.1.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Pet Sitter API",
            "version": "0.0.1",
        },
        "components": {
            "schemas": schemas.get("$defs"),
        },
    }
    print(yaml.dump(openapi_schema, sort_keys=False))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

If we run `python models.py`, we see that our `Pet` schema now includes descriptions for each field.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Pet Sitter API
  version: 0.0.1
components:
  schemas:
    Owner:
      description: "An Owner of Pets in the system.


        ID is unique.

        Can have multiple pets."
      properties:
        id:
          description: Owner's unique identifier
          title: Owner ID
          type: integer
        name:
          description: The owner's full name
          title: Owner Name
          type: string
        pets:
          description: The pets that belong to this owner
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
          title: Owner's Pets
          type: array
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - pets
      title: Owner
      type: object
    Pet:
      description: "A Pet in the system.


        ID is unique.

        Can have multiple owners."
      properties:
        id:
          description: The pet's unique identifier
          title: Pet ID
          type: integer
        name:
          description: Name of the pet
          title: Pet Name
          type: string
        breed:
          description: Breed of the pet
          title: Pet Breed
          type: string
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - breed
      title: Pet
      type: object
```

### Adding OpenAPI Example Values to Pydantic Models

Examples help API users understand your API's data structures, and some SDK and documentation generators use OpenAPI example values to generate useful code snippets and documentation.

Let's add example values to the `Pet` and `Owner` Pydantic models. Once again, we'll use the `Field` class from Pydantic to add example values to the fields.

Note that the examples are added as a list per field, using the `examples` parameter.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    """
    A Pet in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple owners.
    """

    id: int = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet ID",
        description="The pet's unique identifier",
        examples=[1],
    )
    name: str = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet Name",
        description="Name of the pet",
        examples=["Fido"],
    )
    breed: str = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet Breed",
        description="Breed of the pet",
        examples=["Golden Retriever", "Siamese", "Parakeet"],
    )


class Owner(BaseModel):
    """
    An Owner of Pets in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple pets.
    """

    id: int = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner ID",
        description="Owner's unique identifier",
        examples=[1],
    )
    name: str = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner Name",
        description="The owner's full name",
        examples=["John Doe"],
    )
    pets: list[Pet] = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner's Pets",
        description="The pets that belong to this owner",
        examples=[{"id": 1}],
    )


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    openapi_schema = {
        "openapi": "3.1.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Pet Sitter API",
            "version": "0.0.1",
        },
        "components": {
            "schemas": schemas.get("$defs"),
        },
    }
    print(yaml.dump(openapi_schema, sort_keys=False))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

If we run `python models.py`, we see that our `Pet` schema now includes example values for each field.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Pet Sitter API
  version: 0.0.1
components:
  schemas:
    Owner:
      description: "An Owner of Pets in the system.


        ID is unique.

        Can have multiple pets."
      properties:
        id:
          description: Owner's unique identifier
          examples:
            - 1
          title: Owner ID
          type: integer
        name:
          description: The owner's full name
          examples:
            - John Doe
          title: Owner Name
          type: string
        pets:
          description: The pets that belong to this owner
          examples:
            - id: 1
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
          title: Owner's Pets
          type: array
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - pets
      title: Owner
      type: object
    Pet:
      description: "A Pet in the system.


        ID is unique.

        Can have multiple owners."
      properties:
        id:
          description: The pet's unique identifier

```

### Marking Fields as Optional in Pydantic Models

By default, Pydantic marks all fields as required. You can mark a field as optional by setting the `default` parameter to `None`.

Let's mark the `breed` field in the `Pet` model as optional by setting the `default` parameter to `None`.

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class Pet(BaseModel):
    """
    A Pet in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple owners.
    """

    id: int = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet ID",
        description="The pet's unique identifier",
        examples=[1],
    )
    name: str = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet Name",
        description="Name of the pet",
        examples=["Fido"],
    )
    breed: str | None = Field(
        None,
        title="Pet Breed",
        description="Breed of the pet",
        examples=["Golden Retriever", "Siamese", "Parakeet"],
    )


class Owner(BaseModel):
    """
    An Owner of Pets in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple pets.
    """

    id: int = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner ID",
        description="Owner's unique identifier",
        examples=[1],
    )
    name: str = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner Name",
        description="The owner's full name",
        examples=["John Doe"],
    )
    pets: list[Pet] = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner's Pets",
        description="The pets that belong to this owner",
        examples=[{"id": 1}],
    )


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    openapi_schema = {
        "openapi": "3.1.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Pet Sitter API",
            "version": "0.0.1",
        },
        "components": {
            "schemas": schemas.get("$defs"),
        },
    }
    print(yaml.dump(openapi_schema, sort_keys=False))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

If we run `python models.py`, we see that the `breed` field in the `Pet` schema now has two types: `string` and `null`, and it has been removed from the `required` list. Only `id` and `name` are required fields after marking `breed` as optional.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Pet Sitter API
  version: 0.0.1
components:
  schemas:
    Owner:
      description: "An Owner of Pets in the system.

          type: integer
        name:
          description: The owner's full name
          examples:
            - John Doe
          title: Owner Name
          type: string
        pets:
          description: The pets that belong to this owner
          examples:
            - id: 1
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
          title: Owner's Pets

            - type: "null"
          default: null

          examples:
            - Golden Retriever
            - Siamese

      required:
        - id
        - name
      title: Pet
      type: object
```

### Adding Enums to OpenAPI using Pydantic Models

Enums in OpenAPI are useful for defining a set of possible values for a field.

Let's add an enum called `PetType` to the `Pet` model to represent different types of pets.

```python
from enum import StrEnum
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic.json_schema import models_json_schema


class PetType(StrEnum):
    """
    An enumeration of pet types.
    """

    DOG = "dog"
    CAT = "cat"
    BIRD = "bird"


class Pet(BaseModel):
    """
    A Pet in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple owners.
    """

    pet_type: PetType = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet Type",
        description="Type of pet",
        examples=["dog", "cat", "bird"],
    )
    id: int = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet ID",
        description="The pet's unique identifier",
        examples=[1],
    )
    name: str = Field(
        ...,
        title="Pet Name",
        description="Name of the pet",
        examples=["Fido"],
    )
    breed: str | None = Field(
        None,
        title="Pet Breed",
        description="Breed of the pet",
        examples=["Golden Retriever", "Siamese", "Parakeet"],
    )


class Owner(BaseModel):
    """
    An Owner of Pets in the system.

    ID is unique.
    Can have multiple pets.
    """

    id: int = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner ID",
        description="Owner's unique identifier",
        examples=[1],
    )
    name: str = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner Name",
        description="The owner's full name",
        examples=["John Doe"],
    )
    pets: list[Pet] = Field(
        ...,
        title="Owner's Pets",
        description="The pets that belong to this owner",
        examples=[{"id": 1}],
    )


def print_json_schema(models):
    _, schemas = models_json_schema(
        [(model, "validation") for model in models],
        ref_template="#/components/schemas/{model}",
    )
    openapi_schema = {
        "openapi": "3.1.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Pet Sitter API",
            "version": "0.0.1",
        },
        "components": {
            "schemas": schemas.get("$defs"),
        },
    }
    print(yaml.dump(openapi_schema, sort_keys=False))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_json_schema([Pet, Owner])
```

In our generated OpenAPI schema, we have a new `pet_type` field in the `Pet` schema.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0

  title: Pet Sitter API
  version: 0.0.1
components:

          examples:
            - John Doe
          title: Owner Name
          type: string
        pets:

        breed:
          anyOf:
            - type: string
            - type: "null"
          default: null
          description: Breed of the pet
          examples:
            - Golden Retriever
            - Siamese
            - Parakeet

      enum:
        - dog
        - cat
        - bird
      title: PetType
      type: string
```

This enum is represented as a separate schema in the OpenAPI document.

## Adding Paths and Operations to the OpenAPI Schema

Now that we have generated an OpenAPI schema from our Pydantic models, we can use the schema to generate SDK clients for our API.

However, the OpenAPI document we generated, while valid, does not include the `paths` section, which defines the API endpoints and operations.

When using Pydantic with FastAPI, you can define your API endpoints and operations directly in your FastAPI application. [FastAPI automatically generates the OpenAPI schema for your API](./fastapi.mdx), including the `paths` section.

Let's see how we can define API endpoints and operations in a framework-agnostic way and add them to the OpenAPI schema.

### Install openapi-pydantic

We'll use the [`openapi-pydantic`](https://github.com/mike-oakley/openapi-pydantic/) library to define a complete OpenAPI schema with paths and operations.

The benefit of using `openapi-pydantic` is that it allows you to define the API endpoints and operations in a Python dictionary, while still getting the benefit of Pydantic's IDE support and type checking.

The library includes convenience methods to convert Pydantic models to OpenAPI schema components and add them to the OpenAPI schema.

Install the `openapi-pydantic` library:

```bash Terminal
pip install openapi-pydantic
```

### Define API Endpoints

Create a new file called `api.py` to define the API endpoints using the `openapi-pydantic` library:

```python api.py
from typing import List
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from openapi_pydantic.v3 import OpenAPI, Info, PathItem, Operation
from openapi_pydantic.util import PydanticSchema, construct_open_api_with_schema_class
from models import Pet, Owner

# Define response wrapper models
class PetsResponse(BaseModel):
    """A response containing a list of pets"""
    pets: List[Pet] = Field(..., description="List of pets")

class OwnersResponse(BaseModel):
    """A response containing a list of owners"""
    owners: List[Owner] = Field(..., description="List of owners")

                            },
                        }

                            },
                        }
                    },
                ),
            ),
        },
    )

# Generate the complete OpenAPI document
open_api = construct_base_open_api()
open_api = construct_open_api_with_schema_class(open_api)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("openapi.yaml", "w") as file:
        file.write(
            yaml.dump(
                open_api.model_dump(
                    by_alias=True, mode="json", exclude_none=True, exclude_unset=True,
                ),
                sort_keys=False,
            )
        )
```

This code defines:

1. Response models that wrap our Pydantic models (like `PetsResponse`) for consistent API responses
2. A function that builds the OpenAPI document with four endpoints:
   - `GET /pets`: Lists all pets
   - `POST /pets`: Creates a new pet
   - `GET /pets/{pet_id}`: Gets a pet by ID
   - `GET /owners`: Lists all owners
3. Each endpoint includes:
   - An `operationId` for SDK generation
   - A description of what the endpoint does
   - Request parameters/body (where applicable)
   - Response schemas that reference our Pydantic models

When run, this generates an `openapi.yaml` file with the full API specification:

```yaml openapi.yaml

```

The generated OpenAPI document includes all the components from our Pydantic models, along with the API endpoints we defined. The schemas include all the titles, descriptions, examples, and other details we added to our Pydantic models.

## Generating an SDK from the OpenAPI Schema

Now that we have a complete OpenAPI schema with paths and operations, we can use it to generate an SDK client for our API.

### Prerequisites for SDK Generation

Install Speakeasy by following the [Speakeasy installation instructions](/docs/speakeasy-cli/getting-started#install).

On macOS, you can install Speakeasy using Homebrew:

```bash Terminal
brew install speakeasy-api/homebrew-tap/speakeasy
```

Authenticate with Speakeasy using the following command:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy auth login
```

### Generate an SDK Using Speakeasy

Run the following command to generate an SDK from the `openapi.yaml` file:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy quickstart
```

Follow the onscreen prompts to provide the necessary configuration details for your new SDK such as the name, schema location and output path. Enter `openapi.yaml` when prompted for the OpenAPI document location and select TypeScript when prompted for which language you would like to generate.

### Adding Speakeasy Extensions to the OpenAPI Schema

Speakeasy uses [OpenAPI extensions](../../openapi/extensions.md) to provide additional information for generating SDKs.

We can add extensions using [OpenAPI Overlays](../../openapi/overlays.mdx), which are YAML files that [Speakeasy overlays on top of the OpenAPI schema](/docs/prep-openapi/overlays/create-overlays).

Alternatively, you can add extensions directly to the OpenAPI schema using the `x-` prefix.

For example, you can add the [`x-speakeasy-retries` extension](../../docs/customize-sdks/retries.mdx) to have Speakeasy generate retry logic in the SDK.

Import the `Dict` and `Any` types from the `typing` module in `api.py`, and `ConfigDict` from `pydantic`.

We'll use these types to define the `x-speakeasy-retries` extension in the OpenAPI schema.

```python api.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict
from openapi_pydantic.v3 import OpenAPI, Info, PathItem, Operation
from openapi_pydantic.util import PydanticSchema, construct_open_api_with_schema_class
from models import Pet, Owner

# Define response models
class PetsResponse(BaseModel):
    """A response containing a list of pets"""
    pets: List[Pet] = Field(..., description="List of pets")

class OwnersResponse(BaseModel):
    """A response containing a list of owners"""
    owners: List[Owner] = Field(..., description="List of owners")

# Define OpenAPI class with retry extension
class OpenAPIwithRetries(OpenAPI):
    """OpenAPI with x-speakeasy-retries extension"""
    xSpeakeasyRetries: Dict[str, Any] = Field(
        ...,
        description="Retry configuration for the API",
        alias="x-speakeasy-retries",
    )
    model_config = ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True)

def construct_base_open_api() -> OpenAPIwithRetries:
    return OpenAPIwithRetries(
        openapi="3.1.0",
        info=Info(title="Pet Sitter API", version="0.0.1"),
        servers=[{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:4010", "description": "Local prism server"}],
        # Add retry configuration
        xSpeakeasyRetries={
            "strategy": "backoff",
            "backoff": {
                "initialInterval": 500,
                "maxInterval": 60000,
                "maxElapsedTime": 3600000,
                "exponent": 1.5,
            },
            "statusCodes": ["5XX"],
            "retryConnectionErrors": True,
        },
        # Define API paths (endpoints)
        paths={
            # ... API endpoints defined the same as before ...
        }
    )
```

This produces an OpenAPI schema with retry functionality:

```yaml openapi.yaml
x-speakeasy-retries:
  strategy: backoff
  backoff:
    initialInterval: 500
    maxInterval: 60000
    maxElapsedTime: 3600000
    exponent: 1.5
  statusCodes:
    - 5XX
  retryConnectionErrors: true
```

### Add Tags to the OpenAPI Schema

To group operations in the OpenAPI schema, you can use tags. This also allows Speakeasy to structure the generated SDK code and documentation logically.

Add a `tags` field to the `OpenAPIwithRetries` object, then add a `tags` field to each operation in the `construct_base_open_api` function:

```python api.py
def construct_base_open_api() -> OpenAPIwithRetries:
    return OpenAPIwithRetries(
        # Basic API info
        openapi="3.1.0",
        info=Info(title="Pet Sitter API", version="0.0.1"),

        # Define tags for grouping operations
        tags=[
            {"name": "pets", "description": "Operations about pets"},
            {"name": "owners", "description": "Operations about owners"},
        ],

        # API endpoints with tags applied
        paths={
            "/pets": PathItem(
                get=Operation(
                    operationId="listPets",
                    tags=["pets"],
                    # other properties...
                ),
            ),
            # other endpoints...
        },
    )
```

Run `python api.py` to update the `openapi.yaml` file with the `tags` field, then regenerate the SDK using Speakeasy.

```bash Terminal
python api.py
speakeasy quickstart
```

Speakeasy will detect the changes to your OpenAPI schema, generate the SDK with the updated tags, and automatically increment the SDK's version number.

Take a look at the generated SDK to see how Speakeasy groups operations by tags.

## We Can Help Get Your Pydantic Models Ready for SDK Generation

In this tutorial, we learned how to generate an OpenAPI schema from Pydantic models and use it to generate an SDK client using Speakeasy.
