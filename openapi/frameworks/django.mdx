# How to generate an OpenAPI document with Django and Django REST framework

OpenAPI is a tool for defining and sharing REST APIs, and Django can be paired with Django REST framework to build such APIs.

This guide walks you through generating an OpenAPI document from a Django project and using it to create SDKs with Speakeasy, covering the following steps:

1. Setting up a simple Django REST API with `djangorestframework`
2. Integrating `drf-spectacular`
3. Creating the OpenAPI document to describe the API
4. Customizing the OpenAPI schema
5. Using the Speakeasy CLI to create an SDK based on the schema
6. Integrating SDK creation into CI/CD workflows

## Requirements

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Django project structure and how REST APIs work.

You will also need the following installed on your machine:

- Python version 3.8 or higher
- Django

  You can install Django using the following command:

  ```bash Terminal
  pip install django
  ```

- Django REST Framework

  You can install Django REST Framework using the following command:

  ```bash Terminal
  pip install djangorestframework
  ```

## Example Django REST API repository

## Creating the OpenAPI document to describe an API

To better understand the process of generating an OpenAPI document with Django, let's start by inspecting some simple CRUD endpoints for an online library, along with a `Book` class and a serializer for the data.

### Models, serializers, and views

<ScrollyCoding fullHeight>

## !!steps

Find the `books/models.py` file in the root of the repository. Open the file to see a `Book` model containing a few fields with validation:

```python ! models.py focus=1:8
!from ./assets/django/models.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

In the `books/serializers.py` file, there is a `BookSerializer` class that you can use to serialize and deserialize your Book data:

```python !! serializers.py focus=1:10
!from ./assets/django/serializers.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

The `books/views.py` file contains a `BookViewSet` class that uses Django REST Framework's `ModelViewSet` to handle all of the CRUD operations for the `Book` model:

```python ! views.py focus=1:94
!from ./assets/django/views.py.txt
```

This code defines a simple Django REST API with CRUD operations for a `Book` model. The `BookViewSet` class provides a way to interact with the `Book` model through the API.
It also contains a custom action called `author_books` that retrieves all books by the same author.


---

## !!steps

The `books/urls.py` file contains a router that maps the `BookViewSet` to the `/books` endpoint:

```python !! urls.py
!from ./assets/django/urls.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

In the `books_project/urls.py` file, the router is included in the main Django URL configuration:

```python ! project_urls.py
!from ./assets/django/project_urls.py.txt
```


</ScrollyCoding>



## Integrate `drf-spectacular`

Django no longer supports the built-in OpenAPI document generation, so we'll use the `drf-spectacular` package to generate the OpenAPI document.

Run the following to install `drf-spectacular`:

```bash Terminal
pip install drf-spectacular
```

<ScrollyCoding fullHeight>

## !!steps

Open the `books_project/settings.py` file. You should see `'drf_spectacular'` in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python !! settings.py focus=11:21 mark=20
!from ./assets/django/settings.py.txt
```

Adding this package to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list enables OpenAPI document generation for your Django project.


---

## !!steps

The `books_project/settings.py` file also contains the `REST_FRAMEWORK` configuration object, which sets the schema class used to create the OpenAPI document:

```python !! settings.py focus=87:89
!from ./assets/django/settings.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Notice `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS`, which contains additional settings for OpenAPI document generation. You can customize these settings to fit your project:

```python !! settings.py focus=91:117
!from ./assets/django/settings.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

In the `books_project/urls.py` file, the new OpenAPI schema and Swagger UI endpoints are added alongside the `api/` endpoint:

```python ! project_urls.py mark=7:9
!from ./assets/django/project_urls.py.txt
```


</ScrollyCoding>


### Apply migrations and run the server

To inspect and interact with the OpenAPI document, you need to apply database migrations and run the development server.

Apply database migrations:

```bash Terminal
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the development server:

```bash Terminal
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access the API and documentation:

* Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/` to interact with the book API.
* Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/` for Swagger documentation.

### OpenAPI document generation

Now that we understand our Django REST API, we can generate the OpenAPI document using `drf-spectacular` with the following command:

```bash Terminal
python manage.py spectacular --file openapi.yaml
```

<ScrollyCoding fullHeight>

## !!steps

This command will generate an OpenAPI document in the `openapi.yaml` file.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=1:170
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Return to the `books_project/settings.py` file to see how the values in `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS` influence the OpenAPI document generation:

```python !! settings.py focus=91:103
!from ./assets/django/settings.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Notice that the title, description, and versions are reflected in the generated OpenAPI document:

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=1:15
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

The server URL is also included in the OpenAPI document:

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=280:282
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Open the `books/models.py` file to see the `Book` parameters:

```python !! models.py focus=4:6
!from ./assets/django/models.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

These same `Book` parameters are reflected in the OpenAPI document:

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=236:256
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```

</ScrollyCoding>


## OpenAPI document customization

The OpenAPI document generated by `drf-spectacular` may not be detailed enough for all use cases. Fortunately, it can be customized to better serve information about your API endpoints. You can add descriptions, tags, examples, and more to make the documentation more informative and user-friendly.

In the [customized](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/django-openapi-example/tree/customized) branch of the example repository, you can find a customized OpenAPI document that demonstrates the available options for modifying your generated document.

The `drf-spectacular` package provides decorators to directly modify the schema for your views and viewsets.

- `@extend_schema_view`: Allows customization of all methods in a viewset.
- `@extend_schema`: Allows customization of individual methods or actions.

<ScrollyCoding fullHeight>

## !!steps

As an example of how you can customize the schema of the `BookViewSet`, open the `books/views.py` file and update it with the following code:

```python ! views.py
!from ./assets/django/custom_views.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

You can extend or override the document generation for specific views or viewsets using the `@extend_schema_view` decorator:

```python ! views.py focus=9:26
!from ./assets/django/custom_views.py.txt
```

---

## !!steps

This results in the following additions, for example, to the `/api/books/` `get` operation in the document:

```yaml !! openapi.yaml focus=17:36
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Then, you can use the `@extend_schema` decorator to customize individual actions:

```python ! views.py focus=36:70
!from ./assets/django/custom_views.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

This results in the following additions to the `get` operation for `author_books` in the document:

```yaml !! openapi.yaml focus=178:234
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

You can make the OpenAPI documentation more readable and organized by specifying tags and descriptions for your viewset methods:

```python ! views.py focus=36:53 mark=38,53
!from ./assets/django/custom_views.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

This adds a list of tags to the viewset methods in the OpenAPI document:

```yaml !! openapi.yaml focus=201:203
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

You can customize query parameters for your API endpoint. For example, you can add filtering or sorting options:

```python ! views.py focus=54:57
!from ./assets/django/custom_views.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

These options then reflect as follows:

```yaml !! openapi.yaml focus=184:200 mark=186,197
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

You can add examples, such as an example of a book object, to assist anyone using your API:

```python ! views.py focus=58:69
!from ./assets/django/custom_views.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

The document is then updated with the examples:

```yaml !! openapi.yaml focus=216:223
!from ./assets/django/openapi.yaml.txt
```


---

## !!steps

You can add global retries to the OpenAPI document by modifying `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS` in the `books_project/settings.py` file:

```python ! settings.py focus=104:116
!from ./assets/django/settings.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

It is also possible to apply the retries setting to specific views or viewsets using the `@extend_schema` decorator:

```python !! views.py focus=40:52
!from ./assets/django/custom_views.py.txt
```


</ScrollyCoding>

In summary, the `drf-spectacular` package provides a variety of ways to customize the OpenAPI document for your Django REST API. You can use decorators, tags, descriptions, parameters, fields, examples, and global settings to modify the document according to your requirements.

- **Decorators (@extend_schema and @extend_schema_view):** Customize individual methods or entire views.
- **Tags and descriptions:** Organize endpoints for better readability.
- **Parameters:** Define custom parameters using `OpenApiParameter`.
- **OpenAPI components:** Use `OpenApiExample` to provide reusable components or examples.
- **Global settings (`SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS`):** Modify the global behavior of `drf-spectacular`.

For more information about customizing the OpenAPI schema with `drf-spectacular`, refer to the official [`drf-spectacular` documentation](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).



## Creating SDKs for a Django REST API

To create a Python SDK for the Django REST API, run the following command:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy quickstart
```

Follow the onscreen prompts to provide the configuration details for your new SDK, such as the name, schema location, and output path. When prompted, enter `openapi.yaml` for the OpenAPI document location, select a language, and generate.

## Add SDK generation to your GitHub Actions

The Speakeasy [`sdk-generation-action`](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action) repository provides workflows for integrating the Speakeasy CLI into your CI/CD pipeline, so that your SDKs are recreated whenever your OpenAPI document changes.

You can set up Speakeasy to automatically push a new branch to your SDK repositories for your engineers to review before merging the SDK changes.

For an overview of how to set up automation for your SDKs, see the Speakeasy [SDK Generation Action and Workflows](/docs/speakeasy-reference/workflow-file) documentation.

## SDK customization

Explore the effects of your newly generated OpenAPI document on the SDK created by Speakeasy.

After creating your SDK with Speakeasy, you will find a new directory containing the generated SDK code. Let's explore this code a bit further.

These examples assume a Python SDK named `books-python` was generated from the example Django project above. Edit any paths to reflect your environment if you want to follow in your own project.

<ScrollyCoding fullHeight>

## !!steps

Navigate into the `books-python/src/books` directory and open the `book.py` file created by Speakeasy. Note how the OpenAPI document was used to create the `Book` class:

```python ! book.py
!from ./assets/django/book.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Open the `api.py` file to see the methods that call the web API from an application using the SDK:

```python !! api.py mark=12
!from ./assets/django/api.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Notice the `server_url` parameter in the `api.py` file, which was configured in the `SERVERS` key under `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS` in the `settings.py` file:

```python !! api.py focus=12:21 mark=19
!from ./assets/django/api.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

And the `retries` parameter:

```python !! api.py focus=12:21 mark=18
!from ./assets/django/api.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

This is all used to build the request to the API endpoint:

```python !! api.py focus=35:50
!from ./assets/django/api.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

Finally, you should get the result of the global retries strategy set up in `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS` in the `settings.py` file:

```python ! retries.py focus=11:27
!from ./assets/django/retries.py.txt
```


---

## !!steps

You can also find a method implementing the retries strategy:

```python ! retries.py focus=66:112
!from ./assets/django/retries.py.txt
```
