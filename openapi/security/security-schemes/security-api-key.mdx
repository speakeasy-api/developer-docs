# API Key Security Scheme in OpenAPI


An API Key security scheme is the most common form of authentication for machine-to-machine APIs and supports passing a pre-shared secret in several ways. The secret can be passed either via the Authorization header (or another custom header), as a query parameter, or via a cookie.


Here's an example of an API key being passed in the query string.

```http
GET /drinks?api_key=abcdef12345
```

or as a request header:

```http
GET /something HTTP/1.1

Speakeasy-API-Key: abcdef12345
```

or as a cookie:

```http
GET /something HTTP/1.1

Cookie: X-API-KEY=abcdef12345
```

API Keys are one of the most commonly used mechanism, but depending on what that key is and how its generated it may not well be very secure. This is especially true if the key is passed outside of headers or cookies (that is, via query params, as various logging mechanisms normally store query param information).

The biggest security flaw is that most pre-shared secrets are long-lived and if intercepted, can be used until they are either revoked or expire (generally in months or years). This risk is normally tolerated for machine-to-machine applications as the chance of interception (especially when using private VPCs/TLS and other mechanisms) is relatively low compared to a key from a user's device traveling on a public network.

Regardless of which method you use, HTTPS/TLS is highly recommended.

## API Key Object

The fields for an API Key security scheme are as follows:

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`type`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "`apiKey`" },
    { field: "`description`", type: "String", required: "", description: "Human-readable information. This may contain [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to provide a rich description." },
    { field: "`in`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The location of the API key in the request. Valid values are `query`, `header`, or `cookie`." },
    { field: "`name`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The name of the key parameter in the location." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to the security scheme object to be used by tooling and vendors." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

To describe an API key, create an object in `securitySchemes` with a name of whatever you like. Perhaps it's just called `ApiKey` but it could be called `anythingYOULikeAuth`. So long as its easy to remember and a valid YAML string. Then the object defines `type: apiKey` and the name of the header/query/cookie parameter as it should show up in the HTTP request.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKey:
      type: apiKey
      name: Speakeasy-API-Key
      in: header
security:
  - ApiKey: []
```

A description can be added to let API users know where to go to find an API key, or an email address to request one.

## Multiple API keys

Some APIs require two API keys to be used at once, like an app ID and an app Key. In this case, it's possible to define both keys as `securitySchemes` then reference them both in the same [security requirement object](../../security.mdx).

```yaml
security:
  - AppId: []
    AppKey: [] # no leading dash
components:
  securitySchemes:
    AppId:
      type: apiKey
      name: Speakeasy-App-Id
      in: header
    AppKey:
      type: apiKey
      name: Speakeasy-App-Key
      in: header
```
