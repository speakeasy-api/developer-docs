# Bearer Security Scheme in OpenAPI

The Bearer security scheme allows passing a token (most commonly a JWT) in the Authorization header.

A Bearer security scheme is generally used for short-lived tokens granted to your API users through an additional login mechanism. Using a JWT allows for storing additional metadata within the token, which can be helpful for some use cases, such as storing scopes for permissions models.

The fields for a Bearer security scheme are as follows:

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`type`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "`http`" },
    { field: "`description`", type: "String", required: "", description: "Human-readable information. This may contain [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to provide a rich description." },
    { field: "`scheme`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "`bearer`" },
    { field: "`bearerFormat`", type: "String", required: "", description: "A hint to the client to identify how the bearer token is formatted. Bearer tokens are usually generated by an authorization server, so this information is primarily for documentation purposes." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to the security scheme object to be used by tooling and vendors." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>
