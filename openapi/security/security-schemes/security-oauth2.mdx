# OAuth 2 Security Scheme in OpenAPI

OAuth 2 is a popular open authentication mechanism that supports an
authentication flow allowing servers to authenticate on behalf of a user, and/or
a whole application. 

While more generally used for authenticating end-users (e.g.: Log in with
Facebook), it is also used machine-to-machine flows where a whole application
authenticates itself with the API (e.g. Connect Shopify to Xero).

OAuth 2 is considered more secure than other mechanisms due to its granted
privileges through short-lived tokens that limit damage from intercepted tokens.
Tokens that can only be used for a day can only cause damage for a day, and a
well built API will not allow those tokens to be used to escelate privileges
(change users password) so there's less damage to be done whilst the token is
valid.

The OAuth 2 protocol defines multiple ways of building a request against the
`tokenUrl` endpoint, and supports mutliple flows at once so that different types
of integrations can be set up for the same API.

## OAuth 2 Security Scheme Object in OpenAPI

The fields for an OAuth 2 security scheme are as follows:

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`type`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "`oauth2`" },
    { field: "`description`", type: "String", required: "", description: "Human-readable information. This may contain [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to provide a rich description." },
    { field: "`flows`", type: "Map[{key}, [OAuth Flow Object](#oauth-flow-object)]", required: "✅", description: "An object containing configuration for the available OAuth 2 flows. Valid keys are `implicit`, `password`, `clientCredentials`, and `authorizationCode`." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to the security scheme object to be used by tooling and vendors." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

Below is an example of an OAuth 2 security scheme using the `clientCredentials` flow:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    clientCredentials:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        clientCredentials:
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
security:
  - clientCredentials: []
```

## OAuth Flow Object in OpenAPI

The value of the `flows` object is a map of OAuth 2 flow objects.

The four OAuth 2 flows that OpenAPI v3.1 supports are:

- `clientCredentials` (previously, `application` in OpenAPI 2.0) - [Client Credentials Flow Object](#client-credentials-flow-object)
- `authorizationCode` (previously, `accessCode` in OpenAPI 2.0) - [Authorization Code Flow Object](#authorization-code-flow-object)
- `password` - [Password Flow Object](#password-flow-object)
- `implicit` - [Implicit Flow Object](#implicit-flow-object)

Each flow object has its own configuration parameters, so let's look at them individually.

### Client Credentials Flow Object in OpenAPI

The Client Credentials flow is generally used for machine-to-machine
communication where a specific user's permission and context is not required.
Think of an entire application integrating with a whole other application, to
sync billing information or other organization-wide information.

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`tokenUrl`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The token URL to be used for this flow." },
    { field: "`refreshUrl`", type: "String", required: "", description: "The URL to be used for refreshing the token. No refresh URL means the token is not refreshable." },
    { field: "`scopes`", type: "Map[String, String]", required: "✅", description: "The available scopes for the OAuth 2 flow, with a description for each scope. Although the specification requires this field, it can be an empty object." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to an OAuth Flow object to be used by tooling and vendors to add additional metadata and functionality to the OpenAPI Specification." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

The example below shows an OAuth 2 security scheme using the `clientCredentials` flow:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    clientCredentials:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        clientCredentials:
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access
```

### Authorization Code Flow Object in OpenAPI

The Authorization Code flow is generally used for server-side applications where
the client secret can be securely stored.

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`authorizationUrl`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The authorization URL to be used for this flow." },
    { field: "`tokenUrl`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The token URL to be used for this flow." },
    { field: "`refreshUrl`", type: "String", required: "", description: "The URL to be used for refreshing the token. No refresh URL means the token is not refreshable." },
    { field: "`scopes`", type: "Map[String, String]", required: "✅", description: "The available scopes for the OAuth 2 flow, with a description for each scope. Although the specification requires this field, it can be an empty object." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to an OAuth Flow object to be used by tooling and vendors to add additional metadata and functionality to the OpenAPI Specification." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

The example below shows an OAuth 2 security scheme using the `authorizationCode` flow:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    authorizationCode:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access
```



### Password Flow Object in OpenAPI

The Password flow is generally used for trusted first-party clients that can
securely store the client secret.

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`tokenUrl`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The token URL to be used for this flow." },
    { field: "`refreshUrl`", type: "String", required: "", description: "The URL to be used for refreshing the token. No refresh URL means the token is not refreshable." },
    { field: "`scopes`", type: "Map[String, String]", required: "✅", description: "The available scopes for the OAuth 2 flow, with a description for each scope. Although the specification requires this field, it can be an empty object." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to an OAuth Flow object to be used by tooling and vendors to add additional metadata and functionality to the OpenAPI Specification." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

The example below shows an OAuth 2 security scheme using the `password` flow:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    password:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        password:
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access
```

### Implicit Flow Object in OpenAPI

The Implicit flow is generally used for browser/client-side applications that
can't keep a client secret, as in a browser all code and data is available to
the user. This was popular for a while, but IETF's OAuth working group
recommends **not using the implicit grant** anymore. Read more about why
[here](https://medium.com/oauth-2/why-you-should-stop-using-the-oauth-implicit-grant-2436ced1c926).

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`authorizationUrl`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "The authorization URL to be used for this flow." },
    { field: "`refreshUrl`", type: "String", required: "", description: "The URL to be used for refreshing the token. No refresh URL means the token is not refreshable." },
    { field: "`scopes`", type: "Map[String, String]", required: "✅", description: "The available scopes for the OAuth 2 flow, with a description for each scope. Although the specification requires this field, it can be an empty object." },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to an OAuth Flow object to be used by tooling and vendors to add additional metadata and functionality to the OpenAPI Specification." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

The example below shows an OAuth 2 security scheme using the `implicit` flow:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    implicit:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        implicit:
          authorizationUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/authorize
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access
```

## OAuth 2 Security Scheme With Multiple Flows in OpenAPI

If an API needs multiple OAuth 2 flows then that's absolutely fine. To do this,
describe each of the flows in the `flows` object. Here's an example using the
`authorizationCode` and `clientCredentials` flows:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    oauth2:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access
        clientCredentials:
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access
security:
  - oauth2: []
```

If different endpoints supported different flows, then they would be split into
different `securitySchemes`. In this example, the whole API is secured by
`clientCredentials`, except for the `/profile` endpoint, which requires
`authorizationCode`.

```yaml
security:
  - MachineAuth: []

paths:
  "/profile": 
    security: 
      - UserAuth: []

components:
  securitySchemes:
    UserAuth:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access

    MachineAuth:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        clientCredentials:
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            read: Grants read access
            write: Grants write access

```

## Scopes in OAuth 2 in OpenAPI

Scopes are used to define more granular permissions or access controls.

Sometimes this is very generic like `read` and `write`. 

Some APIs focus on different resources:

- `invoices`
- `customers`
- `orders`

Some go even further and break scopes into resources and actions: 

- `invoices:read`
- `invoices:write`
- `invoices:delete`
- `customers:read`
- `customers:write`
- `customers:delete`
- `orders:read`
- `orders:write`
- `orders:delete`

This not only makes sure people are not seeing things they should not be seeing,
but limits accidental data loss when misconfigured applications go rogue.

The scopes are defined in the `scopes` object of the OAuth flow object, and the
scopes required for a specific operation are defined in the `security` object of
the operation.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    oauth2:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes:
            'drinks:read': Grants read access to drinks resource
            'drinks:write': Grants write access to drinks resource
paths:
  /drinks:
    get:
      operationId: listDrinks
      summary: Get a list of drinks
      security:
        - oauth2:
            - drinks:read
```

### No scopes

Scopes are optional, and an API may not use them at all. If that is the case the scopes can be defined as an empty object `{}`, and an empty list of scopes `[]` as the security requirement.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    oauth2:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/token
          refreshUrl: https://speakeasy.bar/oauth2/refresh
          scopes: {}
security:
  - oauth2: []
```

## What about OAuth 2.1 and Device Authorization?

OAuth 2.1 is a simplified version of OAuth 2 that combines the best practices and
removes the less secure flows. There are not many changes which are directly related to OpenAPI, the existing structure works fine.

For more information on OAuth 2.1, you can refer to the [OAuth 2.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13) to understand the changes and improvements made in this version. 

There is a new OAuth flow called Device Authorization, which is not yet supported in OpenAPI v3.1. This will be added in OpenAPI v3.2, which is currently in development.

For more information on the Device Authorization flow, take a look at the [OAuth 2 Device Authorization Grant specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628).
