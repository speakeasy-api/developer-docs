# Mutual TLS Security Scheme in OpenAPI

Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a security protocol that enhances the security of API
communication by requiring both the client and server to authenticate each other
using digital certificates. This two-way authentication ensures that only
trusted parties can establish a connection, providing an additional layer of
security. 

OpenAPI lets you define a Mutual TLS security scheme using the `mutualTLS` type.

## Defining a Mutual TLS Security Scheme

To define a Mutual TLS security scheme in OpenAPI, you can use the following
structure:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    MutualTLS:
      type: mutualTLS
      description: Mutual TLS authentication for secure API communication.
```

There are no additional fields required for the `mutualTLS` type, it is purely
there to indicate that the API requires mutual TLS authentication. The
`description` field can be used to provide additional information about who to
talk to for a certificate, or what the process is for obtaining a certificate.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    MutualTLS:
      type: mutualTLS
      description: > 
        To access this API, you must provide a valid client certificate. 
        Please submit a request to the [infrastructure team](https://example.com) with 
        full information about what this application is to obtain a certificate.
```

That's all there is to this one.
