# Basic Security Scheme in OpenAPI

A Basic security scheme is a simple authentication mechanism baked into the HTTP protocol that supports sending an Authorization header containing an encoded username and password.

A Basic security scheme can be a relatively simple mechanism to get started with, but risks leaking easy-to-decode passwords if used incorrectly.

Basic security also shares the downside of API keys in that the password is generally long-lived and if intercepted, can be used until it is either revoked or expires.

The fields for a Basic security scheme are as follows:

<Table
  data={[
    { field: "`type`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "`http`" },
    { field: "`description`", type: "String", required: "", description: "Human-readable information. This may contain [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to provide a rich description." },
    { field: "`scheme`", type: "String", required: "✅", description: "`basic`" },
    { field: "`x-*`", type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)", required: "", description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to the security scheme object to be used by tooling and vendors." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "field", header: "Field" },
    { key: "type", header: "Type" },
    { key: "required", header: "Required" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    auth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
security:
