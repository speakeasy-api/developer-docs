# The Operation Object in OpenAPI

An operation object describes a single API operation within a path, including all its possible inputs and outputs and the configuration required to make a successful request.

Each operation object corresponds to an HTTP verb, such as `get`, `post`, or `delete`.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks:
    get:
      # The Operation Object
      operationId: listDrinks
      summary: Get a list of drinks.
      description: Get a list of drinks, if authenticated this will include stock levels and product codes otherwise it will only include public information.
      security:
        - {}
      tags:
        - drinks
      parameters:
        - name: type
          in: query
          description: The type of drink to filter by. If not provided all drinks will be returned.
          required: false
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/DrinkType"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: A list of drinks.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/Drink"

The above order of fields is recommended for defining the fields in the document to help set the stage for the operation and provide a clear understanding of what it does.
