# Pagination in OpenAPI

Describing a collection of resources in an API may be simple at first, but
certain features like pagination can make it more complex. Pagination is a
common requirement for APIs that return large sets of data, which allows for a
subsection of a collection to be returned (maybe only 20-100 resources) to avoid
overwhelming the server, the client, and all the network components in between.

This is usually implemented as a query parameter, such as `?page=1` or
`?cursor=abc123`, so that a client can request a specific page of results. The
API can then return a subset of the data, and depending on the specific
pagination strategy used there could also be metadata about the total number of
items and the total number of pages. That metadata allows a client to display
pagination controls in the interface such as "Page 1", "Page 2", or simply
"Next" and "Previous" buttons.

You can learn more about various approaches to pagination in the API design guide
[here](/api-design/pagination).

This guide will show you how to implement pagination in OpenAPI, regardless of
which strategy the API has chosen.

## Pagination with query parameters

Query parameters are a common way to implement pagination in APIs. The most
common query parameters for pagination are `page` and `limit`, which specify the
page number and the number of items per page, respectively.
This is a common approach for paginating through large sets of data, and is
often used in REST APIs.

```yaml
paths:
  /stations:
    get:
      summary: Get a list of train stations
      description: Returns a paginated and searchable list of all train stations.
      operationId: get-stations
      parameters:
        - name: page
          in: query
          description: The page number to return
          required: false
          schema:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            default: 1
          example: 1
        - name: limit
          in: query
          description: The number of items to return per page
          required: false
          schema:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            maximum: 100
            default: 10
          example: 10
```

Adding the `page` and `limit` query parameters advertises to the API consumers
that the API supports pagination. Pagination is mentioned in the description
too, increasing the chance of it being noticed by any API client developers.

The `page` parameter specifies the page number the API should return, and the
optional `limit` parameter specifies the number of items to return for that
page. This is helpful for mobile apps that want to return a grid of data to the
user. For example a 3x3 grid of items, which would require 9 items to be
returned, instead of the default 10 giving the user a blank space in the grid.

## Describing pagination metadata

When implementing pagination, a common practice is to include metadata in the
response to provide information about the total number of items, the current
page, and the total number of pages. This metadata can be included in the
response body, or sometimes is done with custom HTTP headers (which is frowned
upon but done anyway).

Using a `meta` object in an array would not work, so APIs often wrap the
collection with an "envelope" which might be something like `data`.

```json
{
  "data": [
    ...
  ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 2,
    "size": 10,
    "total_pages": 100
  }
```

If the API is doing this, the response can be described with the following OpenAPI:

```yaml
responses:
  '200':
    description: A paginated list of train stations.
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Station'
            meta:
              type: object
              properties:
                page:
                  type: integer
                  example: 2
                size:
                  type: integer
                  example: 10
                total_pages:
                  type: integer
                  example: 100
```

This meta object can be defined in `components` and referenced to avoid repeating it 
in every endpoint.

## Describing pagination with response links

Adding a query parameter to the API is a good start, but asking API clients to
construct URLs from little bits of data is always confusing and a recipe for
disaster. REST APIs offer the ability to send links which can be used to
crawl the API following links like a browser would. 

If the API supports pagination links they
need to be described so clients can use them. The most common way to do this is to
include a `links` object in the response.

```json
{
  "data": [
    ...
  ],
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.example.com/stations?page=2",
    "next": "https://api.example.com/stations?page=3",
    "prev": "https://api.example.com/stations?page=1"
  }
}
```

That links object can be described in OpenAPI like using the following approach:

```yaml
responses:
  '200':
    description: OK
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          allOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Wrapper-Collection'
            - properties:
                data:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Station'
            - properties:
                links:
                  allOf:
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Links-Self'
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Links-Pagination'

components:
  Station:
      description: A train station.
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          format: uuid
          description: Unique identifier for the station.
          examples:
            - efdbb9d1-02c2-4bc3-afb7-6788d8782b1e
            - b2e783e1-c824-4d63-b37a-d8d698862f1d
        # ... snip ...
  Links-Self:
    description: The link to the current resource.
    type: object
    properties:
      self:
        type: string
        format: uri
  Links-Pagination:
    description: Links to the next and previous pages of a paginated response.
    type: object
    properties:
      next:
        type: string
        format: uri
      prev:
        type: string
        format: uri
  Wrapper-Collection:
    type: object
    properties:
      data:
        description: The wrapper for a collection is an array of objects.
        type: array
        items:
          type: object
      links:
        description: A set of hypermedia links which serve as controls for the client.
        type: object
        readOnly: true
```

In this example, the `links` object contains three links: `self`, `next`, and
`prev`. The `self` link points to the current page of results, while the `next`
and `prev` links point to the next and previous pages of results, respectively.
The `links` object is described in the OpenAPI specification using the `links`
object, which is a common way to describe hypermedia links in OpenAPI.

## Describing pagination with HTTP headers

Some APIs use custom HTTP headers to provide pagination information instead of trying to wedge the information into the response body and using `data` and `meta`. This has the benefit of keeping the JSON clean and tidy, but can be confusing as there is no standard for pagination headers. The `Link` header is a standard HTTP header that can be used to provide links for general HATEOAS purposes but also for pagination specifically, but it does not have anywhere to pass pagination metadata about numbers of pages.

For example, an API might use something like `X-Total-Count` header to indicate the total number of items in
the collection, and the `X-Page` and `X-Per-Page` headers to indicate the
current page and the number of items per page, then next and previous links in the `Link` header.

```yaml
paths:
  /stations:
    get:
      summary: Get a list of train stations
      description: Returns a paginated and searchable list of all train stations.
      operationId: get-stations
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A paginated list of train stations.
          headers:
            X-Total-Count:
              description: The total number of items in the collection.
              schema:
                type: integer
                example: 1000
            X-Page:
              description: The current page number.
              schema:
                type: integer
                example: 2
            X-Per-Page:
              description: The number of items per page.
              schema:
                type: integer
                example: 10
            Links:
              description: A set of hypermedia links which serve as controls for the client.
              type: string
              example: |
                <https://api.example.com/stations?page=2>; rel="self",
                <https://api.example.com/stations?page=3>; rel="next",
                <https://api.example.com/stations?page=1>; rel="prev"
              
```

However the API is doing pagination, OpenAPI can describe it. The most
important thing is to be consistent and clear about how pagination works in the
API reference documentation, and if possible write a custom guide for explaining pagination in an API more specifically so that API consumers can get it right. 

## Speakeasy SDK pagination
Speakeasy SDKs support pagination out of the box, and can be configured to
automatically handle pagination for any API, allowing clients to focus on working with data instead of learning about specific pagination strategies.

To configure pagination, add the `x-speakeasy-pagination` extension to the OpenAPI description:

```yaml
/stations:
  get:
    parameters:
      - name: page
        in: query
        schema:
          type: integer
        required: true
    responses:
      "200":
        description: OK
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                data:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: integer
              required:
                - data
    x-speakeasy-pagination:
      type: offsetLimit
      inputs:
        - name: page
          in: parameters
          type: page
      outputs:
        results: $.data
```

The `x-speakeasy-pagination` configuration supports `offsetLimit`, `cursor`, and `url` implementations of pagination, and allows the generated SDKs to extract the proper response data from the API instead of having to split up data and metadata manually.
