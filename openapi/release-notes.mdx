## OpenAPI 3.1 vs 3.0

OpenAPI 3.1 introduces JSON Schema compliance, improved webhooks support, and breaking changes like the discontinued support for semantic versioning. You may want to stick to OpenAPI 3.0 because it offers:

- **Easier migration from OpenAPI 2.0:** Incremental changes make the transition smoother.
- **More stable tooling support:** Many API tools and frameworks still default to OpenAPI 3.0.

## OpenAPI 3.1.1 vs 3.1.0

[OpenAPI 3.1.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/releases/tag/3.1.1) is not a feature release but a refinement of OpenAPI 3.1.0. It improves terminology, JSON Schema alignment, reference handling, and documentation clarity without introducing breaking changes from OpenAPI 3.1.0. The most interesting change is in terminology.

Previously, "OpenAPI document" and "OpenAPI definition" were used inconsistently. OpenAPI 3.1.1 standardizes these definitions:

- **OpenAPI description:** The complete API definition, which may span multiple documents.
- **OpenAPI document:** A single file that makes up the whole or a part of an OpenAPI description.
- **OpenAPI entry document:** The starting point of an OpenAPI description, from which references can be resolved.

If your OpenAPI definition spans multiple files, the entry document is the file that tools like Swagger or Redoc first load to process your API definition.

## What's new in OpenAPI 3.1?

OpenAPI 3.1 introduces the following changes.

### Full JSON Schema 2019-09 support

In OpenAPI 3.0, handling `null` values requires the use of a separate `nullable` property, which is inconsistent with JSON Schema standards.

In OpenAPI 3.1, `nullable` has been removed, and you can use `null` directly as a valid type, which aligns with the JSON Schema 2019-09.

### Nullable in OpenAPI 3.0

The following schema demonstrates how to define nullability in OpenAPI 3.0:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  value:
    type: string
    nullable: true
```

### Null in OpenAPI 3.1

The equivalent schema in OpenAPI 3.1 uses a union type to represent `null`:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  value:
    type: ["string", "null"]
```

You can learn more about nullability in Speakeasy's [OpenAPI schemas](/openapi/schemas/null) documentation.

### Webhooks support

Before OpenAPI 3.x, the OpenAPI Specification didn't provide a way to describe event-driven behavior.

OpenAPI 3.0 introduces `callbacks`, which allow for the documenting of asynchronous requests from the server back to the client. While `callbacks` aren't a perfect fit for modeling webhooks, they are often used as a workaround for doing so.

OpenAPI 3.1 introduces a dedicated `webhooks` field for documenting outgoing API events (for example, notifying a client when a user is created).

### Webhooks in OpenAPI 3.0

In OpenAPI 3.0, you need to use a workaround like `callbacks` to document webhooks:

```yaml
paths:
  /subscribe:
    post:
      summary: Subscribe to price change events
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                callbackUrl:
                  type: string
                  format: uri
              required:
                - callbackUrl
      responses:
        "202":
          description: Subscription accepted
      callbacks:
        onPriceChange:
          "{$request.body#/callbackUrl}":
            post:
              summary: Price change notification
              requestBody:
                required: true
                content:
                  application/json:
                    schema:
                      type: object
                      properties:
                        id:
                          type: string
                        price:
                          type: number
                      required:
                        - id
                        - price
              responses:
                "200":
                  description: Notification received
```

### Webhooks in OpenAPI 3.1

With OpenAPI 3.1, you can define `webhooks` directly:

```yaml
webhooks:
  userRegistered:
    post:
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                userId:
                  type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Acknowledged
```

OpenAPI does not provide a way to explicitly link a webhook with its registration, which is needed to allow users to subscribe to alerts, but you can address this by following the Speakeasy guide to [using webhooks in OpenAPI](/post/openapi-tips-webhooks-callbacks#creating-a-webhook-in-openapi).

### Path items in components

In OpenAPI 3.0, if you have multiple endpoints with similar structures (for example, user-related paths like `/users/{id}` and `/admins/{id}`), you have to repeat the same request structure for each path.

OpenAPI 3.1 allows reusable path item objects to be stored in `components.pathItems`, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

### Paths in OpenAPI 3.0

In OpenAPI 3.0, each path has to be fully defined, even if multiple endpoints share the same request structure:

```yaml
paths:
  /users/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Get user information
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: User data

  /admins/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Get admin information
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Admin data
```

### Paths in OpenAPI 3.1

In OpenAPI 3.1, you can define the path structure once and reuse it across multiple paths:

```yaml
components:
  pathItems:
    userLookup:
      get:
        summary: Get user or admin information
        parameters:
          - name: id
            in: path
            required: true
            schema:
              type: string
        responses:
          "200":
            description: User or admin data

paths:
  /users/{id}:
    $ref: "#/components/pathItems/userLookup"

  /admins/{id}:
    $ref: "#/components/pathItems/userLookup"
```

### Breaking changes in OpenAPI 3.1

Apart from these structural improvements, **OpenAPI 3.1 introduces breaking changes** that may require modifications to existing OpenAPI documents. Here are the most important ones:

- **OpenAPI no longer follows semantic versioning (SemVer):** Future updates may introduce breaking changes, even in minor version increments.
- **`exclusiveMaximum` and `exclusiveMinimum` values must be numeric:** Boolean values (`true` and `false`) are no longer valid. Use a numeric limit instead.
- **`format` no longer defines file payloads:** You can no longer use `format: binary` or `format: base64`. Use `contentEncoding` and `contentMediaType` instead.
- **The `jsonSchemaDialect` field has been added:** A new top-level field allows you to specify the default `$schema` value for schema objects, ensuring consistency in JSON Schema validation.
