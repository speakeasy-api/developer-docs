# Request Body Object in OpenAPI

The request body is used to describe the HTTP body of the request for
operations. Not all operations require a request body, but when they do, the
request body is defined in the `requestBody` field of the operation object.

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks:
    post:
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:
                  type: string
                  description: The name of the drink.
                ingredients:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
                  description: The ingredients of the drink.
                instructions:
                  type: string
                  description: Instructions to prepare the drink.
```

## Request Body Object

Here's how the `requestBody` object is structured:

<Table
  title="Request Body Object Fields"
  data={[
    {
      field: "`description`",
      type: "String",
      required: "",
      description: "A description of the request body. This may contain [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to provide a rich description."
    },
    {
      field: "`content`",
      type: "[Content](/openapi/paths/operations/content)",
      required: "âœ…",
      description: "A map of [Media Type Objects](/openapi/paths/operations/content#media-type-object) that defines the possible media types that can be used for the request body."
    },
    {
      field: "`required`",
      type: "Boolean",
      required: "",
      description: "Whether the request body is required. Defaults to `false`."
    },
    {
      field: "`x-*`",
      type: "[Extensions](/openapi/extensions)",
      required: "",
      description: "Any number of extension fields can be added to the Request Body Object that can be used by tooling and vendors."
    }
  ]}
  columns={[
    {
      key: "field",
      header: "Field"
    },
    {
      key: "type",
      header: "Type"
    },
    {
      key: "required",
      header: "Required"
    },
    {
      key: "description",
      header: "Description"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Required vs optional

Request bodies are optional by default in OpenAPI, so adding the `requestBody`
property does not mean it expects the HTTP request to actually be present. It
means it _can_ be present. 

This can be changed by setting the `required` property to `true`, but it is
often forgotten and lots of tooling will remind you to add a required property,
even if its set to `required: false`, just to make sure there is nothing spooky
or unexpected happening.

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks:
    post:
      requestBody:
        description: The drink to create.
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:
                  type: string
                  description: The name of the drink.
                ingredients:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
                  description: The ingredients of the drink.
                instructions:
                  type: string
                  description: Instructions to prepare the drink.
```

Getting this right is not just important for API documentation, but for
generated SDKs that should know whether or not to throw errors, and data
validations libraries/middlewares which should know whether or not to reject an
invalid request.

When should a request body be optional? 

Not all that often, but it can be useful for things like `PATCH` requests
where no changes are happening but you want to "touch" the resource to update the `updatedAt` timestamp. 

```http
PATCH /drinks/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
```

To support this use case, the `requestBody` can be set to be optional.

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks/{id}:
    patch:
      requestBody:
        description: The drink to update.
        required: false
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:
                  type: string
                  description: The name of the drink.
                ingredients:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
                  description: The ingredients of the drink.
                instructions:
                  type: string
                  description: Instructions to prepare the drink.
```

Sometimes an API will set a request body for a DELETE request, but this is less
common and recommended against in both [RFC9110: HTTP
Semantics](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-delete) and the
OpenAPI specification. 

Still, OpenAPI begrudgingly allows `DELETE` to describe a `requestBody` knowing
that some legacy APIs will have done this, and some tooling will even support it.

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks/{id}:
    delete:
      requestBody:
        description: The drink to delete.
        required: false
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                reason:
                  type: string
                  description: The reason for deleting the drink.
```

It's important to describe the API correctly, regardless of which best practices
it has gone against, but whenever possible channel the feedback to the
developers and see if those mistakes can be avoided in the future.

## Encoding Object

Only applicable to `requestBody` where the media type is `multipart` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. An encoding object describes the encoding of a single property in the request schema.

<Table
  title="Encoding Object Fields"
  data={[
    {
      field: "`contentType`",
      type: "String",
      required: "",
      description: "The content type of the field. If the field is an `object`, the default is `application/json`. If the field is an array, the default is based on the inner type. Otherwise, the default is `application/octet-stream`. Valid values are either a media type (for example, `application/json`), a wildcard media type (for example, `image/*`), or a comma-separated list of media types and wildcard media types (for example, `image/png, application/*`)."
    },
    {
      field: "`headers`",
      type: "Map[string, [Header Object](/openapi/paths/operations/responses/headers) | [Reference Object](/openapi/references#openapi-reference-object)]",
      required: "",
      description: "Only applies to `multipart` requests. Allows additional headers related to the field. For example, if the client needs to add a `Content-Disposition` for an uploaded file. A `Content-Type` header in this map will be ignored, in favor of the `contentType` field of the encoding object."
    },
    {
      field: "`style`",
      type: "String",
      required: "",
      description: "Can take one of the following values: `form`, `spaceDelimited`, `pipeDelimited`, or `deepObject`. Specifies the style of the field's serialization only in requests with media type `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. See the description of `style` under [Query Parameters](/openapi/paths/parameters/query-parameters)."
    },
    {
      field: "`explode`",
      type: "Boolean",
      required: "",
      description: "Only applies to requests with media type `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and fields with `array` or `object` types. If `style` is `form`, the default is `true`, otherwise the default is `false`."
    },
    {
      field: "`allowReserved`",
      type: "Boolean",
      required: "",
      description: "Only applies to requests with media type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Determines whether reserved characters (those allowed in literals but with reserved meanings) are allowed in the parameter's content. The default is `false`. When `true`, it allows reserved characters as defined by [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.2) to be included without percent-encoding. This can be useful for parameters with content such as URLs."

                  Content-Disposition:
                    description: Specifies the disposition of the file (attachment and file name).
                    schema:
                      type: string
                      default: 'form-data; name="photo"; filename="default.jpg"'
                allowReserved: false
                # style: form - not applicable to strings
                # explode: false - not applicable to strings
```

## anyOf and oneOf

Sometimes a request body could contain multiple different data structures:

```yaml
requestBody:
  description: A JSON object containing pet information
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        oneOf:
          - $ref: "#/components/schemas/DebitCard"
          - $ref: "#/components/schemas/CreditCard"
          - $ref: "#/components/schemas/BankTransfer"
          - $ref: "#/components/schemas/IDEAL"
```
