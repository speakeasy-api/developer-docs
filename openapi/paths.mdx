# Paths Object in OpenAPI

The `paths` object is a map of [Path Item Objects](/openapi/paths#path-item-object) that describes the available paths and operations for the API.

Each path is a relative path to the servers defined in the [Servers](/openapi/servers) object, either at the document, path, or operation level. For example, if a server is defined as `https://speakeasy.bar/api` and a path is defined as `/drinks`, the full URL to the path would be `https://speakeasy.bar/api/drinks`, where the path is appended to the server URL.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks:
    get: ... # operation definition
  /drink:
    get: ... # operation definition
    put: ... # operation definition
    post: ... # operation definition
    delete: ... # operation definition
```

## Path Item Object in OpenAPI

A Path Item Object describes the operations available on a single path. This is generally a map of HTTP methods to [Operation Objects](/openapi/paths/operations) that describe the operations available.

It is possible to override the [Servers](/openapi/servers) defined at the document level for a specific path by providing a list of [Server Objects](/openapi/servers) at the path level.

It is also possible to provide a list of [Parameters](/openapi/paths/parameters) that are common to all operations defined on the path.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks:
    summary: Various operations for browsing and searching drinks
    description:
    servers: # Override the servers defined at the document level and apply to all operations defined on this path
      - url: https://drinks.speakeasy.bar
        description: The drinks server
    parameters: # Define a list of parameters that are common to all operations defined on this path
      - name: type
        in: query
        schema:
          type: string
          enum:
            - cocktail
            - mocktail
            - spirit
            - beer
            - wine
            - cider
    get: ... # operation definition
```

Or:

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks:
    $ref: "#/components/pathItems/drinks" # Reference a Path Item Object defined in the Components Object allowing for reuse in different paths
components:
  pathItems:
    drinks:
      servers:
        - url: https://drinks.speakeasy.bar
          description: The drinks server
      parameters:
        - name: type
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
            enum:
              - cocktail
              - mocktail
              - spirit
              - beer
              - wine
              - cider
      get: ... # operation definition
```

The order of fields above is recommended but is not significant to the order in which the endpoints should be used.
