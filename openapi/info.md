| `x-*`            |     [Extensions](/openapi/extensions)     |          | Any number of extension fields can be added to the info object that can be used by tooling and vendors to add additional metadata and functionality to the OpenAPI Specification. |

The above order of fields is recommended (but is not required by the OpenAPI specification) as it puts the most important information first and allows the reader to get a quick overview of the document and API.
