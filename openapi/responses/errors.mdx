# Errors in OpenAPI

In OpenAPI, errors are typically represented as [responses](/openapi/paths/operations/responses#response-object-in-openapi), with a clear body response structure and a status code in the range of **400-599** describing the error.

A well-designed error response should provide a clear and actionable message that helps the developer describe the error to a user.

## Key elements of an error response

The status code and response body are the key elements of an error response. 

### Status code

HTTP response status codes play a vital role in describing the nature of errors. You should use appropriate codes to indicate the error type:

<Table 
  data={[
    { statusCode: "400", meaning: "Bad Request", exampleUseCase: "Input validation failed" },
    { statusCode: "401", meaning: "Unauthorized", exampleUseCase: "Missing or invalid authentication" },
    { statusCode: "403", meaning: "Forbidden", exampleUseCase: "Insufficient permissions" },
    { statusCode: "404", meaning: "Not Found", exampleUseCase: "Resource does not exist" },
    { statusCode: "413", meaning: "Payload Too Large", exampleUseCase: "File or request body exceeds limit" },
    { statusCode: "415", meaning: "Unsupported Media Type", exampleUseCase: "Invalid content type (for example, text or XML)" },
    { statusCode: "500", meaning: "Internal Server Error", exampleUseCase: "Unexpected server-side issue" }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "statusCode", header: "Status code" },
    { key: "meaning", header: "Meaning" },
    { key: "exampleUseCase", header: "Example use case" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout title="HTTP response status codes" type="info">
  You can find a comprehensive list of HTTP response status codes for client errors (400-499) [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses) and server errors (500-599) [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses).
</Callout>


### Response body

The response body provides the client with additional information about the error that can be displayed to the user. It is recommended to use a structured schema that describes the error in a clear and actionable way. Here is an example:

```yaml
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "The provided file type is not supported.",
  "details": {
    "field": "fileType",
    "allowedValues": ["image/jpeg", "application/pdf"]
  }
}
```

An error response can have these common properties: 

- `error`: A machine-readable error code, such as `ValidationError` or `AuthenticationFailed`.

- `message`: A human-readable description of the error.

- `details`: Additional contextual information about the error, such as invalid fields or allowed values.

You can provide additional properties in the response body, such as the `timestamp` or `trace ID`, to help with debugging and tracking the error.

## Defining error responses in an OpenAPI document

For standard API endpoints, error responses should be defined in the `responses` section of the OpenAPI document. You can use reusable components to standardize error schemas:


```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /resource:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a resource
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
        '400':
          $ref: '#/components/responses/BadRequestError'
        '500':
          $ref: '#/components/responses/InternalServerError'

components:
  responses:
    BadRequestError:
      description: Invalid input provided
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse'
    InternalServerError:
      description: Unexpected server error
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse'
  schemas:
    ErrorResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        error:
          type: string
          description: Machine-readable error code
        message:
          type: string
          description: Human-readable error message
        details:
          type: object
          additionalProperties: true
          description: Additional error context
        timestamp:
          type: string
          format: date-time
        traceId:
          type: string
          description: Unique identifier for error tracing
```


## RFC 9457 Problem Details for Errors

## Standardizing error messages: RFC 9457 Problem Details

[RFC 9457](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9457) is a standard for representing errors in REST APIs. Published in July 2023, it introduces a standardized, machine-readable, and actionable format for describing errors. While RFC 9457 is widely regarded as a best practice, it is important to note that it is not included in the OpenAPI Specification (OAS).

The Problem Details format for describing errors is JSON-based and specifies key properties that are either required, optional, or extensible. When serialized as JSON, the format uses the media type `application/problem+json`. 

The core properties of the Problem Details format are:

- `type`: A URI reference that identifies the problem type, providing documentation or additional context for the error.

- `title`: A short, human-readable summary of the problem type. The title should be consistent across instances of the same problem.

- `status`: The HTTP status code for the error.

- `detail`: A human-readable explanation of the error.

- `instance`: A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem, providing a link for debugging or accessing more information.

Here is how you can apply RFC 9457 to your OpenAPI documentation:


```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /user:
    post:
      summary: Create a new user
      responses:
        '400':
          description: Validation Error
          content:
            application/problem+json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'

components:
  schemas:
    ProblemDetails:
      type: object
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          format: uri-reference
          description: URI reference identifying the problem type.
        title:
          type: string
          description: A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
        status:
          type: integer
          description: HTTP status code for this error occurrence.
        detail:
          type: string
          description: Explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.
        instance:
          type: string
          format: uri-reference
          description: URI reference identifying the specific occurrence of the problem.
```
