title: Retries
description: Communicate to API consumers when they should retry requests, and how
  long to wait before retrying. This can help reduce the number of requests being made to an API 
  when its having a rough time, and can also help consumers avoid tripping over on rate limits.
---

Retries are a common pattern in API design, especially when dealing with
transient errors or rate limits, or connection issues that could have just been
a bit getting flipped somewhere in the ether, but a second attempt would likely
work.

API consumers may or may not automatically retry failed requests, and if they do, they
may not know how long to wait before retrying. This is especially true for rate
limits, where the API may be able to handle a burst of requests, but then
throttle the consumer for a period of time to avoid overwhelming the system.

To avoid confusing consumers who just want to work with an API, it's a good idea
to communicate to them how retries should be used in the API, with that
information clearly explained in API documentation and automatically handled by
SDKs.

# Retries in OpenAPI

Whilst OpenAPI does not having any dedicated functionality describing retries,
it does not need to, as HTTP itself has retries covered.

The `Retry-After` header is defined in RFC 9110 as the standard way to
communicate that a client or server failure has happened, but that a retry is
possible after a certain amount of time. 

```yaml
responses:
  "429":
    description: Too Many Requests
    headers:
      Retry-After:
        description: The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request.
        schema:
          type: integer
          example: 120
```

The most common usage of Retry-After is using the number of seconds to wait
before trying again, but it can also be used to communicate a date and time when
the request can be retried. 

```yaml
responses:
  "429":
    description: Too Many Requests
    headers:
      Retry-After:
        description: The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request.
        schema:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          example: 2025-07-01T12:00:00Z
```

This header is used in a number of different scenarios, including:

- 404 Not Found - The server MAY send a Retry-After header field to indicate that the resource is temporarily unavailable, or could exist in the near future.
- 408 Request Timeout - The server MAY send a Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the client MAY try again.
- 409 Conflict - The server MAY send a Retry-After header field to indicate that the conflict could be temporary and suggest a time where it may have been resolved.
- 413 Content Too Large - If the condition is temporary, the server could send a Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and the client could try again.
- 429 Too Many Requests - The client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, and the server is asking the client to wait before sending more requests.
- 503 Service Unavailable - A service may be unavailable temporarily, so a Retry-After header field could suggest an appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before checking if the service is back.

Some other 5XX errors could well be retryable, such as 504 Gateway Timeout, and
a 507 Insufficient Storage might resolve itself, but it's possible to go too
far. For example, 501 Not Implemented could be seen as temporary because it
could be implemented soon, but nobody wants API consumers retrying to API
forever waiting for a feature to be deployed which is never going to be
deployed.

Describing every single instance of anything that could ever happen in OpenAPI
is not the goal of any API documentation because that is impossible. Focusing on
key areas where retries are likely to be needed is a good balance, and from
there, API consumers can use their own judgement on whether to retry or not.

## Examples or constants

When describing some of these headers it feels important to provide a bit of
context about what the headers contain, either with an exact value, or if that's
not possible then some examples of what values might appear.

Here is an example of how to do that with the `Retry-After` header, using the
Header Object `example` field:

```yaml
headers:
  Retry-After:
    description: The number of seconds to wait before making another request.
    schema:
      type: integer
    example: 3600
```

Using an example here is important because the value of `Retry-After` can vary
depending on the billing plan the user is on. For example, a free plan might
have a `Retry-After` value of 60 seconds, while a paid plan might have a
`Retry-After` value of 10 seconds.

If the value of `Retry-After` is always the same, then using `const` inside the
`schema` object is a good way to indicate that (available from OpenAPI v3.1).

```yaml
headers:
  Retry-After:
    description: The number of seconds to wait before making another request.
    schema:
      type: integer
      const: 3600
```

This indicates that the `Retry-After` value is always 3600 seconds, regardless of
the billing plan the user is on.

## x-speakeasy-retries

Another ways to communicate how retries should work, is using the Speakeasy
vendor extension `x-speakeasy-retries`. Using this extension, OpenAPI can
communicate retry for a particular operation, or the API as a whole, to API
consumers. 

This extension can be used to specify the number of retries, the delay between
retries, and the maximum delay.

```yaml
/webhooks/subscribe:
  post:
    operationId: subscribeToWebhooks
    servers:
      - url: https://speakeasy.bar
    x-speakeasy-usage-example:
      tags:
        - server
        - retries
    x-speakeasy-retries:
      strategy: backoff
      backoff:
        initialInterval: 10
        maxInterval: 200
        maxElapsedTime: 1000
        exponent: 1.15
```

This example shows how to use the `x-speakeasy-retries` extension to specify a
"backoff" strategy for retries, which is a common pattern for retrying failed
requests with longer waits between retries. The `initialInterval` is the time to
wait before the first retry, and the `maxInterval` is the maximum time to wait
between retries. The `maxElapsedTime` is the maximum time to wait before giving
up on retries, and the `exponent` is the exponent to use for the backoff
calculation.

This approach could be used as well as, or instead of, the `Retry-After` header.
It would be a good way to add automatic retries to SDKs which means the client
will be automatically retrying things without needing to learn everything about
which status codes are retryable, and how long to wait before retrying.

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are a common use case for retries, and the `Retry-After` header is a
great way to communicate to API consumers when they should retry requests, and
how long to wait before retrying.

## Best practices

### Examples over constants

When describing the `Retry-After` header, it's a good idea to use examples instead of
constants to allow for flexibility in the API. Some APIs will push up the
`Retry-After` value during times of high load, and some APIs will have different
`Retry-After` values depending on the billing plan the user is on. Using
examples allows for this flexibility, whilst still letting API consumers know
what sort of values they can expect (e.g: integer vs date-time).

### Expand Retry-After in periods of high load

When the API is under heavy load, it's a good idea to expand the `Retry-After`
header to allow for longer wait times between retries. This can help reduce the
number of requests being made to the API, and can also help consumers avoid
tripping over on rate limits.

### Use exponential backoff

When retrying requests, it's a good idea to suggest an exponential backoff
approach, as a server which is struggling to keep up with requests does not need
to be hammered with even more requests. Sometimes it needs a moment to recover,
and clients giving larger gaps between retries can help with that.
