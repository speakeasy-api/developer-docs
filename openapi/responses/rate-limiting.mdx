# Rate limiting in OpenAPI

Rate limiting is the art of trying to protect the API by telling "overactive"
API consumers to calm down a bit, telling clients to reduce the frequency of
their requests, or take a break entirely and come back later to avoid
overwhelming the API.

**Learn more about rate limiting [over here](/api-design/rate-limiting).**

## Rate limiting error response

When a client exceeds the rate limit, the API should respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
This status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, and the error message can explain
that more clearly, especially when using [quality error responses](/api-design/errors).

```yaml
responses:
  "429":
    description: Too Many Requests
    content:
      application/problem+json:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            type:
              type: string
              const: "https://example.com/probs/limit-exceeded"
            title:
              type: string
              const: Rate limit exceeded
            detail:
              type: string
              const: Too many requests in a given amount of time, please try again later.
```

This response describes an error that looks like this:

```http
HTTP/2 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/limit-exceeded",
  "title": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "detail": "Too many requests in a given amount of time, please try again later."
}
```

Describing the `429` response in OpenAPI is important for communicating to API
consumers that there is rate limiting in place, if its been missed elsewhere or
if its only available on some endpoints, this is a good chance to make it clear.

## Retry-After header

The `Retry-After` header is a standard HTTP header that can be included in the
response to indicate how long the client should wait before making another
request. This header can be included in the `429 Too Many Requests` response to
inform the client about the time they should wait before retrying.

```yaml
responses:
  "429":
    description: Too Many Requests
    headers:
      Retry-After:
        description: The number of seconds to wait before making another request.
        schema:
          type: integer
        example: 3600
    content:
      application/problem+json:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            type:
              type: string
              const: "https://example.com/probs/limit-exceeded"
            title:
              type: string
              const: Rate limit exceeded
            detail:
              type: string
              const: Too many requests in a given amount of time, please try again in one hour.
```

With this header added and a more specific error detail added, the response looks more like this.

```http
HTTP/2 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 3600

{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/limit-exceeded",
  "title": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "detail": "Too many requests in a given amount of time, please try again in one hour."
}
```

## Rate limiting headers

Rate limiting headers are HTTP headers that provide information about the rate
limit status of the API. These headers can be included in the success response
**unlike** `Retry-After` which goes on the error. They inform the client about
their current rate limit status, including the number of requests remaining, the
time until the rate limit resets, and the total number of requests allowed.

The following headers are commonly used for rate limiting, even if they are
non-standard, but they show how to implement them in OpenAPI:

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: OK
    headers:
      X-RateLimit-Limit:
        description: The maximum number of requests that the client is allowed to make in a given time period.
        schema:
          type: integer
        example: 1000
      X-RateLimit-Remaining:
        description: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
        schema:
          type: integer
        example: 500
      X-RateLimit-Reset:
        description: The number of seconds until the rate limit resets.
        schema:
          type: integer
        example: 35
```

This response describes a successful request with rate limiting headers included.

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 500
X-RateLimit-Reset: 35
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "example"
  }
}
```

## Rate limiting headers draft RFC

The `X-RateLimit-*` headers are not standard HTTP headers, and they are not
defined in any RFC. A new [RateLimit header draft
RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers/), is
in the works, but is still a draft and not yet an official standard.

This draft RFC outlines a new `RateLimit` header to replace all of the
`X-RateLimit-*` headers, and with a single header it can provide information
about the rate limit status of the API, including the number of requests
remaining, the time until the rate limit resets, and the total number of
requests allowed.

The following example shows a `RateLimit` header with a policy named "default",
which has another 50 requests allowed in the next 30 seconds.

```http
RateLimit: "default";r=50;t=30
```

The `RateLimit` header focuses on the current state of the various quotes, but
it doesn't provide information about the policy itself. The same draft RFC also
outlines a `RateLimit-Policy` header which can be used to provide information
about how the policy works.

This example shows two policies, "default" and "daily". The "default" policy has
a quota of 100 requests and a window of 30 seconds, while the "daily" policy has
a quota of 1000 requests and a window of 86400 seconds (24 hours).

```http
RateLimit-Policy: "default";q=100;w=30,"daily";q=1000;w=86400
```

Trying to describe these headers in OpenAPI is a bit tricky, as the syntax moves beyond
the simple `key: value` pairs that OpenAPI is used to. The following example shows
how to describe the `RateLimit` header in OpenAPI, using a string with a
`pattern` to validate the format of the header value.

```yaml
headers:
  RateLimit:
    description: The rate limit status of the API.
    schema:
      type: string
      pattern: ^"[^"]+";r=\d+;t=\d+$
    example: '"default";r=50;t=30'
```

This example uses a regular expression to validate the format of the `RateLimit`
header value, which is a string that contains the policy name, the number of
requests remaining, and the time until the rate limit resets. The `pattern`
field is used to specify the regular expression that the header value must
match. The `example` field is used to provide an example of the header value,
which is a string that contains the policy name, the number of requests
remaining, and the time until the rate limit resets.

The `RateLimit-Policy` header can be described in a similar way, using a string
with a `pattern` to validate the format of the header value.

```yaml
headers:
  RateLimit-Policy:
    description: The rate limit policy of the API.
    schema:
      type: string
      pattern: ^"[^"]+";q=\d+;w=\d+$
    example: '"default";q=100;w=30,"daily";q=1000;w=86400'
```

This example uses a regular expression to validate the format of the
`RateLimit-Policy` header value, which is a string that contains the policy name,
the quota of requests, and the window of time. The `pattern` field is used to
specify the regular expression that the header value must match. The `example`
field is used to provide an example of the header value, which is a string that
contains the policy name, the quota of requests, and the window of time.

If these headers are being used, it might be easiest to provide some simple
examples in the operation definitions, and dedicate a more specific "Rate
Limiting Guide" somewhere in the API documentation to explain it all more fully
elsewhere.
