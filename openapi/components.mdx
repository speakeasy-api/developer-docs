# Components in OpenAPI

import { Table } from "@/mdx/components";

The Components object in OpenAPI are reusable bits of OpenAPI description, which
can then be [referenced](/openapi/references). Reusing components allows for
smaller file-sizes, reduces conflicts, and improves consistency across the API.
Components can even be shared them across multiple documents, allowing for
improved reuse between multiple APIs.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
  parameters:
    userId:
      name: uuid
      in: path
      description: Unique UUIDv4 of the user
      required: true
      schema:
        type: string
        format: uuid
  responses:
    NotFound:
      description: User not found
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Error"
  requestBodies:
    User:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/User"
  securitySchemes:
    bearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
```

Components can be referenced in other parts of the OpenAPI document using the
`$ref` keyword. The `$ref` keyword is a JSON Pointer to the component, which
is a string that starts with `#/components/` and then the component type
and name. For example, to reference the `User` schema defined in the
Components Object, you would use the following `$ref`:

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: User found
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/User"
```

To put it all together, here is an example of how to reference all the various components in that previous example:

```yaml
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Get a user by UUID
      parameters:
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/userId"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: User found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/User"
        "404":
          $ref: "#/components/responses/NotFound"
      security:
        - bearerAuth: []
```

## Components Object

The Components Object is a map of reusable components broken down by type.

```yaml
components:
  <componentType>:
    <componentName>: <componentDefinition>
```

The component name can be any valid string, but it is recommended to use a
consistent naming convention across the API. A common naming convention is `PascalCase` or `camelCase`.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Train:
    Station:
    BookingPayments:
```

Here are the supported component types as of OpenAPI v3.1:
