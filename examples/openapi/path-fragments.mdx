# Using Path Fragments to Solve Equivalent Path Signatures

Equivalent path signatures in an OpenAPI specification can cause validation errors and/or unexpected behaviors. Adding unique path fragments is an effective method for resolving these conflicts. Path fragments appended with an anchor (e.g., `#id`, `#name`) make paths unique without altering the API's functionality since the anchor section is not sent in API requests.

## When to Use Path Fragments
Path fragments should be used when the OpenAPI specification contains multiple paths with equivalent signatures but distinct parameter names. For example:

```yaml
paths:
  /v13/deployments/{idOrUrl}:
    get:
      summary: "Get deployment by ID or URL"
      parameters:
        - name: idOrUrl
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
  /v13/deployments/{id}:
    get:
      summary: "Get deployment by ID"
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
```
These paths conflict because their structures are identical, even though their parameter names differ.

## Add Path Fragments

Modify the conflicting paths by appending a unique anchor fragment to each. For example:

   ```yaml
   paths:
     /v13/deployments/{idOrUrl}#idOrUrl:
       get:
         summary: "Get deployment by ID or URL"
         parameters:
           - name: idOrUrl
             in: path
             required: true
             schema:
               type: string
     /v13/deployments/{id}#id:
       get:
         summary: "Get deployment by ID"
         parameters:
           - name: id
             in: path
             required: true
             schema:
               type: string
   ```

Corresponding SDK method signatures:

   ```typescript
   // For /v13/deployments/{idOrUrl}#idOrUrl
   function getDeploymentByIdOrUrl(idOrUrl: string): Deployment {
       // Implementation
   }

   // For /v13/deployments/{id}#id
   function getDeploymentById(id: string): Deployment {
       // Implementation
   }
   ```

## Considerations
- **Impact on Tooling**: Most tools will handle path fragments correctly, but confirm that all downstream tooling supports the updated specification.
- **Path Fragments in Overlays**: Path fragments cannot be added using overlays. They must be introduced directly in the upstream OpenAPI specification.
