# Example Overlays

[Overlays](/docs/prep-openapi/overlays/create-overlays) act as a layer on top of your existing OpenAPI specification, allowing you to apply modifications and extensions seamlessly. They are perfect for adding new features, customizing responses, and adapting specifications to specific needs without disrupting the underlying structure.

To demonstrate the power of overlays, we'll use a sample OpenAPI Specification for "The Speakeasy Bar." This initial spec sets the stage for our overlay examples:

```yaml openapi.yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: The Speakeasy Bar
  version: 1.0.0
  summary: A bar that serves drinks.
servers:
  - url: https://speakeasy.bar
    description: The production server.
security:
  - apiKey: []
tags:
  - name: drinks
    description: The drinks endpoints.
  - name: orders
    description: The orders endpoints.
paths:
  /dinner/:
    post:
      ...
    get:
      ...
  /drinks/:
    post:
      ...
```

Let's explore how overlays can enhance and adapt this specification to do the following: 


* [Adding Speakeasy Extensions](#adding-speakeasy-extensions)
* [Adding SDK Specific Documentation](#adding-sdk-specific-documentation)
* [Modifying Auto-Generated Schemas](#modifying-auto-generated-schemas)
* [Adding Examples to API Documentation](#adding-examples-to-api-documentation)
* [Hiding Internal APIs from a Public SDK](#hiding-internal-apis-from-a-public-sdk)
* [Removing specific PUT operation](#removing-specific-put-operation)
* [Standardize Configurations](#standardize-configurations)


### Adding Speakeasy Extensions

**Objective:** Integrate [Terraform](/docs/terraform/extensions) functionality into the API specification for order management.

**Overlay Action**: 

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Add Terraform Functionality to Order Schema
  version: 1.1.0
actions:
  - target: "$.components.schemas.Order"
    update:
      - x-speakeasy-entity: Order
        description: "Enables Terraform provider support for the Order schema."

```

### Adding SDK Specific Documentation

**Objective:** Provide tailored instructions for Java and JavaScript SDKs for the `/orders` endpoint.

**Overlay Action**:
```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Distinguish Order Endpoint Docs for Java and JavaScript SDKs
  version: 1.1.1
actions:
  - target: "$.paths['/orders'].post.description"
    update:
      - value: "For Java SDK: use `OrderService.placeOrder()`. For JavaScript SDK: use `orderService.placeOrder()`."
```

### Modifying Auto-Generated Schemas

**Objective:**  Enhance the precision of the Drink schema, making it more descriptive and informative for API consumers. 

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Refine Drink Schema for Better Clarity
  version: 1.1.2
actions:
  - target: "$.components.schemas.Drink"
    update:
      - properties:
          type:
            type: string
            description: "Type of drink, e.g., 'cocktail', 'beer'."
          alcoholContent:
            type: number
            description: "Percentage of alcohol by volume."
```


### Adding Examples to API Documentation

**Objective:**  Illustrate the drink ordering process with a practical example for user clarity.

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Add Drink Order Example for User Clarity
  version: 1.1.3
actions:
  - target: "$.paths['/drinks/order'].post"
    update:
      - examples:
          standardOrder:
            summary: "Standard order example"
            value: 
              drink: "Old Fashioned"
              quantity: 1
```

### Hiding Internal APIs from a Public SDK

**Objective:** Restrict the visibility of internal staff management endpoints.

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Secure Internal Staff Management Endpoint
  version: 1.1.4
actions:
  - target: "$.paths['/internal/staff']"
    update:
      - x-internal: true
        description: "This endpoint is restricted for internal staff management and not visible in public SDKs."
```

### Removing Specific Put Operation

**Objective:** Exclude PUT operations without the `x-speakeasy-entity-operation.`

**Overlay Action**: 

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Remove Non-Essential PUT Operations
  version: 1.1.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths.*.put[?(! @.x-speakeasy-entity-operation)]
    remove: true

```

### Standardize Configurations

**Objective:** Remove the server and security configurations from each operation within the paths.

**Overlay Action**: 

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Standardize Server and Security Configurations
  version: 1.1.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths.*.*.servers
    remove: true
  - target: $.paths.*.*.security
    remove: true

```
