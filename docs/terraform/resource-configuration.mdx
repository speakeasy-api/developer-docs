# Resource Configuration

## Resource Description

The `x-speakeasy-entity-description` extension allows modification of the description of a Terraform data or managed resource. This is useful when augmenting the documentation in an OpenAPI specification with documentation for specific resources. This documentation is expected to be in Markdown format. Use this extension alongside the `x-speakeasy-entity` extension.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Order:
      description: An order helps you make coffee
      x-speakeasy-entity: Order
      x-speakeasy-entity-description: |
        The order resource allows you to declaratively construct an order for coffee.

        resource "speakeasy_order" "example" {
          name = "Filter Blend"
          price = 11.5
        }
```

Alternatively, a template folder can be written to customize any or all aspects of generated documentation in alignment with [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs).

## Resource Version

The `x-speakeasy-entity-version` extension specifies the version of a given resource and should *only* be used if you need to write a state migrator, for instance, if you are changing the type of a field.

Terraform resource versions are zero-indexed and default to `0`. For your first breaking change requiring a state migrator, set `x-speakeasy-entity-version: 1`. Each state migrator function must migrate from the previous version of the state.

If this is set, a boilerplate state upgrader will be written and hooked into `internal/stateupgraders/your_resource_v1.go`. Please refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/state-upgrade) for guidance on writing a state migrator.
