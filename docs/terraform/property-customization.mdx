# Customize Terraform Properties

## Remap API Property to Terraform Attribute Name

The `x-speakeasy-name-override` annotation adjusts the Terraform attribute name within a resource while remapping all the API data handling internally. This is useful, for example, to standardize differing API property names across operations to a single attribute name.

```yaml
unique_id:
  type: string
  x-speakeasy-name-override: id
```

The annotation also has other [SDK customization capabilities](/docs/customize-sdks/methods), however, those are generally unnecessary for Terraform providers as the generated Go SDK is internal to the provider code.

## Align API Parameter With Terraform Property

The `x-speakeasy-match` annotation adjusts the API parameter name to align with a Terraform state property. If mismatches occur, a generation error will highlight appropriate root-level properties for accurate mapping.

```yaml
paths:
  /pet/{petId}:
    delete:
      parameters:
        - name: petId
          x-speakeasy-match: id
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#delete
```

## Property Defaults

Setting a property default value that matches your API responses when unconfigured will enhance the Terraform plan to include the known value, rather than propagate the value as unknown `(known after apply)` during creation and updates.

Speakeasy generation automatically adds a Terraform schema attribute default with OAS `default` value, for each of the following OAS types:

| OAS Schema Type | OAS default Support   |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| `array`         | Partial (`[]` only)   |
| `boolean`       | Yes                   |
| `map`           | No                    |
| `number`        | Yes                   |
| `object`        | Partial (`null` only) |
| `oneOf`         | No                    |
| `string`        | Yes                   |

## Hide Sensitive Properties

Properties marked as `x-speakeasy-param-sensitive` will be concealed from the console output of Terraform. This helps to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data within Terraform operations.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        secret:
          type: string
          x-speakeasy-param-sensitive: true
```

## Exclude Property From Terraform State

When `x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true`, this extension ensures the specified property and any interactions involving it are omitted from Terraform's state management.

<Callout title="Info" type="info">
  This extension completely suppresses the property from the Terraform state. If
  you want to suppress a specific operation, use `x-speakeasy-ignore: true` to
  omit the operation from the annotated CRUD method. For example, if a field is
  present in both the `CREATE` and `READ` response bodies, omitting it from the
  `READ` response body will turn off drift detection for that field. The field
  will remain in the `CREATE` response body and the Terraform state.
</Callout>

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        optionalMetadata:
          x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
      required:
        - name
```

```hcl
resource "petstore_pet" "mypet" {
  name = "myPet"
  # Attempting to set an ignored parameter results in an error
  # optionalMetadata = true
}
```

## Custom Types

Set the `x-speakeasy-terraform-custom-type` extension to switch a property from the terraform-plugin-framework base type (e.g. `types.String`) to a [custom type](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/types/custom). Custom types typically include format-specific validation logic (such as a baked-in regular expression) or semantic equality handling to prevent unintentional value differences (such as ignoring inconsequential whitespace).

The following terraform-plugin-framework base types are supported for custom types:

- `Bool`
- `Float32`
- `Float64`
- `Int32`
- `Int64`
- `List`
- `Map`
- `Set`
- `String`

In this example, the `ipv4_address` string property will use the custom `iptypes.IPv4Address` type:

```yaml
ipv4_address:
  type: string
  x-speakeasy-terraform-custom-type:
    imports:
      - github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-nettypes/iptypes
    schemaType: "iptypes.IPv4AddressType{}"
    valueType: iptypes.IPv4Address
```

## Allow JSON String Attributes

Set the `x-speakeasy-type-override` extension to `any` to convert the associated attribute to a JSON string. This allows for inline the specification of the attribute's value, accommodating attributes with variable or dynamic structures.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        deep:
          x-speakeasy-type-override: any
          type: object
          properties:
            object:
              type: object
              additionalProperties: true
              properties:
                in:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    here:
                      type: string
        name:
          type: string
      required:
        - name
```

```hcl
resource "petstore_pet" "mypet" {
  name = "myPet"
  deep = jsonencode({
    object = {
      with = "anything"
      defined = true
    }
  })
}
```

## Suppress Unnecessary Plan Changes

Setting the `x-speakeasy-param-suppress-computed-diff` to true suppresses unnecessary Terraform plan changes for computed attributes that are not definitively known until after application. This is useful in scenarios where computed attributes frequently cause spurious plan changes.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        status:
          x-speakeasy-param-suppress-computed-diff: true
          type: string
```

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
  Applying this modifier when `x-speakeasy-entity-operation: my_resource#read`
  is not defined may result in drift between the Terraform plan and remote state
  should updates to attributes happen outside of Terraform changes. Please only
  apply this when necessary.
</Callout>
