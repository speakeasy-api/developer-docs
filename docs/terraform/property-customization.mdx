# Customize Terraform Properties

## Remap API Property to Terraform Attribute Name

The `x-speakeasy-name-override` annotation adjusts the Terraform attribute name within a resource while remapping all the API data handling internally. This is useful, for example, to standardize differing API property names across operations to a single attribute name.

```yaml
unique_id:
  type: string
  x-speakeasy-name-override: id
```

The annotation also has other [SDK customization capabilities](/docs/customize-sdks/methods), however, those are generally unnecessary for Terraform providers as the generated Go SDK is internal to the provider code.

## Align API Parameter With Terraform Property

The `x-speakeasy-match` annotation adjusts the API parameter name to align with a Terraform state property. If mismatches occur, a generation error will highlight appropriate root-level properties for accurate mapping.


```yaml
paths:
  /pet/{petId}:
    delete:
      parameters:
        - name: petId
          x-speakeasy-match: id
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#delete
```

##  Hide Sensitive Properties

Properties marked as `x-speakeasy-param-sensitive` will be concealed from the console output of Terraform. This helps to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data within Terraform operations.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        secret:
          type: string
          x-speakeasy-param-sensitive: true
```

## Exclude Property From Terraform State

When `x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true`, this extension ensures the specified property and any interactions involving it are omitted from Terraform's state management.

<Callout title="Info" type="info">
This extension completely suppresses the property from the Terraform state. If you want to suppress a specific operation, use `x-speakeasy-ignore: true` to omit the operation from the annotated CRUD method. For example, if a field is present in both the `CREATE` and `READ` response bodies, omitting it from the `READ` response body will turn off drift detection for that field. The field will remain in the `CREATE` response body and the Terraform state.
</Callout>

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        optionalMetadata:
          x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
      required:
        - name
```

```
resource "petstore_pet" "mypet" {
  name = "myPet"
  # Attempting to set an ignored parameter results in an error  
  # optionalMetadata = true
}
```

##  Allow JSON String Attributes

Set the `x-speakeasy-type-override` extension to `any` to convert the associated attribute to a JSON string. This allows for inline the specification of the attribute's value, accommodating attributes with variable or dynamic structures.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        deep:
          x-speakeasy-type-override: any
          type: object
          properties:
            object: 
              type: object
              additionalProperties: true
              properties: 
                in:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    here:
                      type: string
        name:
          type: string
      required:
        - name
```

```
resource "petstore_pet" "mypet" {
  name = "myPet"
  deep = jsonencode({
    object = {
      with = "anything"
      defined = true
    }
  })
}
```

## Suppress Unnecessary Plan Changes

Setting the `x-speakeasy-param-suppress-computed-diff` to true suppresses unnecessary Terraform plan changes for computed attributes that are not definitively known until after application. This is useful in scenarios where computed attributes frequently cause spurious plan changes.


```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        status:
          x-speakeasy-param-suppress-computed-diff: true
          type: string
```


<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
Applying this modifier when `x-speakeasy-entity-operation: my_resource#read` is not defined may result in drift between the Terraform plan and remote state should updates to attributes happen outside of Terraform changes. Please only apply this when necessary.
</Callout>
