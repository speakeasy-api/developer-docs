# Provider Configuration

## Security

The generated Terraform Provider will automatically implement all global security as defined in the OpenAPI Specification via the root level `security` property and its associated `securitySchemes` components. Multiple security options are supported.

In this example, the provider will be generated with bearer authenticiation token requirement using an `access_token` provider-level attribute:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    accessToken:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
security:
  - accessToken: []
```

Refer to the [Configuring Environment Variables section](#configuring-environment-variables) to optionally enable fallback environment variable configuration of the value.

Operation-level security is not supported nor recommended. Instead, it is generally more desirable to implement separate providers per security layer. Terraform practitioners are conventionally used to the layering of provider implementations for this use case and Terraform itself is designed around those separation of concerns. Refer to the [HashiCorp provider design principles documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/best-practices/hashicorp-provider-design-principles) for more context.

## Globals

Enable provider-level configuration of common properties across many resources via the [`x-speakeasy-globals` extension](/docs/customize/globals). This customization allows Terraform practitioners to configure a value via:

* Provider-level only: Default value applied to any resources that use the global
* Resource-level only: Explicit value applied to only those resource instance(s)
* Provider-level with resource-level override: Default value applied to any resources that use the global with any explicit resource-level configuration overriding the provider-level value

In this example, the provider will accept an `organization_id` configuration as a global:

```yaml
x-speakeasy-globals:
  parameters:
    - name: organizationId
      in: path
      schema:
        type: string
```

## Configuring Environment Variables

Use the `environmentVariables` configuration in the `gen.yaml` to set up an environment variable fallback for provider attribute data configuration. For example, accepting an access token value via environment variable, rather than requiring explicit `provider` block attribute configuration from Terraform practitioners.

```yaml
terraform:
  environmentVariables:
    - env: EXAMPLE_SERVER_URL_FROM_ENV_VAR
      providerAttribute: server_url
    - env: EXAMPLE_ACCESS_TOKEN
      providerAttribute: access_token
```

The `environmentVariables` configuration is expected to be a list of objects with `{env: string, providerAttribute: string}` keys and values. These will create associations from environment variables (referenced as `env`) with provider attributes (referenced as `providerAttribute`).

## Additional Provider Configurations

Enable Terraform configurations to specify additional provider-wide customizations in the generation configuration (`gen.yaml`) file with the `additionalProviderAttributes` configuration, for example:

```yaml
terraform:
  additionalProviderAttributes:
    # ... configuration ...
```

### Custom HTTP Headers

Set the `httpHeaders` configuration with the desired attribute name to enable Terraform configurations to specify a mapping of additional HTTP headers for all HTTP requests.

In this example, HTTP header customization is enabled using the `http_headers` provider attribute name:

```yaml
terraform:
  additionalProviderAttributes:
    httpHeaders: http_headers
```

This configuration enables provider configuration such as:

```hcl
provider "examplecloud" {
  http_headers = {
    "X-Example-Header" = "example-value"
  }
}
```

### Skip TLS Verification

Set the `tlsSkipVerify` configuration with the desired attribute name to enable Terraform configurations to specify a boolean to disable TLS verification in the HTTP client.

In this example, TLS verification customization is enabled using the `tls_skip_verify` provider attribute name:

```yaml
terraform:
  additionalProviderAttributes:
    tlsSkipVerify: tls_skip_verify
```

This configuration enables provider configuration such as:

```hcl
provider "examplecloud" {
  tls_skip_verify = true
}
```

## Custom Resources or Data Sources

If you would like to include an existing resource that is outside of the Speakeasy-generated provider, reference it in `gen.yaml` like so:

```yaml
terraform:
  additionalResources:
    - importAlias: custom
      importLocation: github.com/custom/terraform-provider-example/src/custom_resource
      resource: custom.NewCustomResource
  additionalDataSources:
    - importAlias: custom
      importLocation: github.com/custom/terraform-provider-example/src/custom_datasource
      datasource: custom.NewCustomDataSource
  additionalEphemeralResources:
    - importAlias: custom
      importLocation: github.com/custom/terraform-provider-example/src/custom_ephemeral_resource
      resource: custom.NewCustomEphemeralResource
```

The `additionalResources` key is expected to contain a list of `{ importLocation?: string, importAlias?: string, resource: string }` objects. Each `resource` will be inserted into the provider managed resource list. If `importLocation` or `importAlias` is defined, Speakeasy will add that to the import list at the top of the provider file. The value of `resource` is arbitrary text, and could contain a function invocation if desired.

The `additionalEphemeralResources` key follows the same syntax, but will insert ephemeral resources into the provider.

The `additionalDataSources` key follows the same syntax, but will insert data resources into the provider using `datasource` (instead of `resource`) as the value inserted into the list.
