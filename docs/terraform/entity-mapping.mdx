#  Map API Entities to Terraform Resources

Add the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation to objects in your OpenAPI spec to include them as entities in the Terraform provider.

As a component:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Order:
      description: An order helps you make coffee
      x-speakeasy-entity: Order
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          description: Numeric identifier of the order.
        name:
          type: string
          description: Product name of the coffee.
        price:
          type: number
          description: Suggested cost of the coffee.
      required:
        - name
        - price
      type: object
```

Or inline in a path:

```yaml
paths:
  /order:
    post:
      tags:
        - Order
      summary: Create a coffee order
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Order#create
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              x-speakeasy-entity: Order
              properties:
                id:
                  type: integer
                  description: Numeric identifier of the order.
                name:
                  type: string
                  description: Product name of the coffee.
                price:
                  type: number
                  description: Suggested cost of the coffee.
              required:
                - name
                - price
              type: object
```

 ```
resource "yourprovider_order" "example" {
  name = "Filter Blend"
  price = 11.5
}
```

Where you place the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation affects the Terraform provider structure.
- **At the top level:** Properties are nested objects.
- **At a lower level:** Properties above the annotation are flattened.


**Top Level** 
```yaml 
Pet:
  x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
  #...
```


 ```
resource "yourprovider_pet" "example" {
  data = { name = "Filter Blend" }
}
```

**Lower Level**
```yaml 
Pet:
  properties:
    data:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      #...
```


```
resource "yourprovider_pet" "example" {
  name = "Filter Blend"
}
```

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
Properties above the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation are flattened, which could cause conflicts. Apply the annotation carefully to align the structure of the Terraform provider with the API&apos;s intended interaction.

## Specify CRUD Operations for API Endpoints

The `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation specifies CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations associated with each endpoint in the OpenAPI spec for a Terraform entity. The value determines the behavior of operations such as create, read, update, and delete and is structured as `Entity#operation,operation,...#order`:
  - `Entity` represents the name of the entity.
  - `operation` can be one or more of `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`, concatenated with commas.
  - `order` is optional and can be used to define additional API calls that should be invoked for a given CRUD invocation.

### Behavior of Operations

- `Entity:create` makes the entity a Terraform resource.
- `Entity:read` ensures consistency with Terraform state, updates attributes, and generates a data source.
- `Entity:update` provides update support for the resource. Without it, any attribute change requires resource replacement (`ForceNew`).
- `Entity:delete` enables deletion of the resource. Without it, no action is taken on deletion.
- `Entity:create,update` **(idempotent operations)** indicates the API is idempotent. Combine these operations to allow the same API call to create new objects and update existing ones, depending on attribute changes.

```yaml
paths:
  /pet:
    post:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Add a new pet to the store
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#create
  /pet/{petId}:
    get:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Info for a specific pet
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#read
    update:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Update the pet
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#update
    delete:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Delete the pet 
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#delete
```

### Multiple API Operations for One Resource

When multiple API operations are necessary for a single resource, use the additional entity-ordering capabilities of the `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation.

```yaml
paths:
  /pet/{petId}:
    get:
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#read#1
  /animal:
    get:
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#read#2
```

Multiple API operations for one resource can be combined with multiple entity operations of [one API operation for multiple resources](#one-api-operation-for-multiple-resources) as necessary.

### One API Operation for Multiple Resources

When a single API operation is necessary for multiple resources, use multiple entity operation entries with the `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation.

```yaml
parameters:
  - in: query
    name: id
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string
operationId: GetAnimal
x-speakeasy-entity-operation:
  - Cat#read
  - Dog#read
```

One API operation for multiple resources can be combined with the entity operation ordering of [multiple API operations for one resource](#multiple-api-operations-for-one-resource) as necessary.

### Manual association between Operations and Resource / Data Sources

The default behavior within Speakeasy is to automatically infer a data source from all operations that have an `x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Entity#read` association defined.

For some APIs, you might want the data source to use a "search" endpoint (e.g., search for an entity by name, where name is non-unique), while using a "get" operation for the resource (e.g., to find an entity by ID for state reconciliation).

In this case, use an object syntax for the `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation to explicitly control whether an operation generates a resource, a data source, or both:

```yaml
paths:
  "/example":
    get:
      operationId: getThing
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation:
        terraform-datasource: null
        terraform-resource: Thing#read
```

This syntax allows you to:
- Prevent automatic generation of a data source by setting `terraform-datasource` to `null`
- Prevent invocation of the operation during the resource's Read method ("invoked as part of terraform state refresh") by setting `terraform-resource` to `null`

For example, the configuration above declares that `getThing` is associated with just a resource, and a data source should not be automatically generated.

### Resources with Soft Delete

By default, a generated managed resource uses the HTTP 404 Not Found status code on read to automatically remove the resource from the Terraform state which causes the next Terraform plan to propose recreating the resource. For resource APIs that support soft delete (grace time period before the resource is fully deleted), the `x-speakeasy-soft-delete-property` annotation adds a check against a read response property to also propose resource recreation.

For managed resources, any `x-speakeasy-soft-delete-property` attribute is omitted from the schema and state. For data resources, the attribute remains to preserve client-side filtering capabilities.

In this example, the resource will be proposed for recreation if the `deleted_at` property has a value:

```yaml
paths:
  "/example":
    get:
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Example#read
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schema/ExampleGetResponse"
components:
  schemas:
    ExampleGetResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        # ...
        deleted_at:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          x-speakeasy-soft-delete-property: true
```
