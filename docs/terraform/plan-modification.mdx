# Plan Modification

## Custom Attribute Plan Modification

Attribute plan modifiers enable advanced default value, resource replacement, and difference suppression logic in managed resources. Due to the Terraform SDK implementation, attribute-level plan modifiers do not have access to provider-level configuration or the API client, however that SDK does support custom resource-level plan modification with implementing the [`resource.ResourceWithModifyPlan` interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#ResourceWithModifyPlan).

Use the `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers` extension to add custom attribute-level plan modification logic to Terraform plan operations.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        age:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers: AgeModifier
```

In this scenario, when Speakeasy next generates the Terraform provider, it will bootstrap a custom plan modifier file located at `internal/planmodifiers/int64planmodifier/age_modifier.go`, and import the schema configuration wherever `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers: AgeModifier` is referenced. Edit the plan modifier file to contain the required logic.

The `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers` extension supports an array of names as well, such as:

```yaml
x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers:
  - FirstPlanModifier
  - SecondPlanModifier
```

### Implementation Notes

1. A plan modifier is a type conformant to the `terraform-plugin-framework` expected interface. A unique plan modifier will be bootstrapped in the appropriate subfolder for the Terraform type it is applied to: `boolplanmodifiers`, `float64planmodifiers`, `int64planmodifiers`, `listplanmodifiers`, `mapplanmodifiers`, `numberplanmodifiers`, `objectplanmodifiers`, `setplanmodifiers`, or `stringplanmodifiers`. Speakeasy will always create and use a file as `snake_case.go` for a given `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers` value.

2. A plan modifier operates on the raw (untyped) Terraform value types. However, you can convert a Terraform type to a value type Speakeasy manages (`type_mytype.go`) by using the included reflection utility. This is useful for applying modifiers to complex types like `list`, `map`, `object`, and `set`.

3. While working with a plan modifier, you have the ability to perform various tasks, including initiating network requests. However, it's important to ensure that plan modifiers do not result in any unintended side effects. Please refer to [the HashiCorp guidance on plan modifier development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/plan-modification) or reach out in our Slack if you have questions.

4. A modifier can only be applied to a resource attribute. The annotation will be ignored for data sources. Modifiers cannot be applied at the same level as the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation because that becomes the "root" of the Terraform resource.

5. Speakeasy regenerations do not delete user-written code. If the modifier is no longer in use, it will be ignored (no longer referenced) but the source file will remain. You might want to delete such an orphaned modifier file for repository hygiene.
