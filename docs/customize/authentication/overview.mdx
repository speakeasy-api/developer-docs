# Security and authentication

## Authentication overview

Speakeasy-created SDKs have authentication automatically configured based on the `securitySchemes` defined in the [OpenAPI specification](/openapi/security).

APIs authenticated with simple schemes, such as Basic HTTP auth, API keys, and bearer tokens, work out of the box. For APIs using short-lived tokens (OAuth), additional configuration is required to simplify setup.
