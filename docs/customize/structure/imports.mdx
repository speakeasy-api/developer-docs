# Customize imports

Speakeasy allows you to customize the paths we generate models to and your users import models from.

By default, Speakeasy uses an OpenAPI-based naming scheme for the namespaces models are bucketed into, for example:

<Callout title="Info" type="info">
  Currently only supported for C#, Go, Python, TypeScript, and Unity SDKs. More
  languages will be added soon.
</Callout>

<Spotlight>

#### !!steps Components

Models generated from components are placed in the `models/components` directory, or the target language idiomatic equivalent.

```yaml ! sdk-tree.yaml focus=3:6
!from ./assets/sdk-tree.yaml
```

---

#### !!steps Operations

Models generated from operations are placed in the `models/operations` directory, or the target language idiomatic equivalent.

```yaml ! sdk-tree.yaml focus=7:12
!from ./assets/sdk-tree.yaml
```

---

#### !!steps Errors

Models that are used in error status codes are placed in the `models/errors` directory (or the idiomatic equivalent for the target language).

```yaml ! sdk-tree.yaml focus=13:16
!from ./assets/sdk-tree.yaml
```

</Spotlight>

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
  The default names for the model directories are consistent across most
  target languages, but C# makes the exception that the `models/Operations` directory is
  called `models/Requests` by default.
</Callout>

## Customize import paths

<Spotlight>

### !!steps imports

Customize where path models are generated to and imported from by modifying the configuration in the `gen.yaml` file.

Configuration like what is shown will result in a file structure as above.

```yaml ! custom-imports.yaml focus=6:13
!from ./assets/custom-imports.yaml
```

---

### !!steps option

The `option` key determines the type of bucketing scheme that is used for the models.

Only `openapi` is currently supported. This will bucket models into `components`, `operations`, `errors`, `callbacks`, and `webhooks` directories.

```yaml ! custom-imports.yaml focus=7
!from ./assets/custom-imports.yaml
```

---

### !!steps paths

The `paths` section contains a map of bucket names to paths relative to the root of the generated SDK.

- `shared` refers to the models generated from the `components` section of the OpenAPI specification. (Note: `shared` is a legacy name for the bucket, retained for backward compatibility.)
- `operations` refers to the models generated for the request and responses of operations in the OpenAPI specification.
- `errors` refers to the models generated for schemas referenced in error status codes responses.
- `callbacks` refers to models generated for schemas within the `callbacks` section of an operation.
- `webhooks` refers to models generated from the `webhooks` section of an OpenAPI 3.1 document.

```yaml ! custom-imports.yaml focus=8:13
!from ./assets/custom-imports.yaml
```

</Spotlight>

You can customize these paths to any path that exists relative to the root of the SDK.

<Callout title="CAUTION" type="warning">
  If you are providing custom path names, make sure there is no conflict with
  any of the existing directories in the SDK. Conflicts will result in
  compilation issues.
</Callout>

Different buckets can also be configured to use the same path, for example:

```yaml gen.yaml
typescript:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models
      errors: models
      operations: models
      shared: models
      webhooks: models
```

This will result in all models being generated to the `models` directory. The generator will then resolve any class name conflicts by prefixing or suffixing class names to ensure they are unique.

## Customize global imports

You can configure the generator to work with a global import path for all models.

For example:

```typescript
import { User, GetDrinkRequest, SDK } from '@speakeasy/bar'
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { SDK } from '@speakeasy/bar'
import { User } from '@speakeasy/bar/dist/models/components/user'
import { GetDrinkRequest } from '@speakeasy/bar/dist/models/operations/user'
```

You will configure global imports slightly differently for different languages:

```yaml !!tabs TypeScript
# For TypeScript to configure global imports, the `imports` section of your `gen.yaml` needs to include the following:

typescript:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models
      errors: models
      operations: models
      shared: models

    paths:
      callbacks: ""
      errors: ""
      operations: ""
      shared: ""
      webhooks: ""

# For global imports in TypeScript, models will always be generated to the `models` directory, regardless of whether the `""` or `"models"` path is specified. However, global imports will only kick in if one of these two values is used for all buckets. This is to ensure the root directory isn&apos;t cluttered with files.

# The configuration example above will result in a directory structure like this:

<Callout title="CAUTION" type="warning">
Global imports will cause namespace pollution for the import and file clutter in the directory models are generated to.

Large APIs containing many models (especially many inline models) will inevitably lead to name conflicts. Rename types verbosely to ensure each class is unique within the namespace.
