# Customize imports

Speakeasy allows you to customize the paths we generate models to and your users import models from.

By default, Speakeasy uses an OpenAPI-based naming scheme for the namespaces models are bucketed into, for example:

<Callout title="INFO" variant="info">
  Currently only supported for C#, Go, Python, TypeScript, and Unity SDKs. More
  languages will be added soon.
</Callout>

<ScrollyCoding>

#### !!steps `Components`

Models generated from components are placed in the `models/components` directory, or the target language idiomatic equivalent.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(3:6)
sdk/
├─ models/
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ user.ts
│  │  ├─ drink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  ├─ operations/
│  │  ├─ getuser.ts
│  │  ├─ updateuser.ts
│  │  ├─ getdrink.ts
│  │  ├─ updatedrink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ errors/
│     ├─ sdkerror.ts
│     ├─ responseerror.ts
│     └─ ...
└─ ...
```

---

#### !!steps `Operations`

Models generated from operations are placed in the `models/operations` directory, or the target language idiomatic equivalent.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(7:12)
```

---

#### !!steps `Errors`

Models that are used in error status codes are placed in the `models/errors` directory (or the idiomatic equivalent for the target language).

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(13:16)
```

</ScrollyCoding>

<Callout title="WARN" variant="info">
  The default names for the model directories are consistent across most
  target languages, but C# makes the exception that the `models/Operations` directory is
  called `models/Requests` by default.
</Callout>

## Customize import paths

<ScrollyCoding>

### !!steps `imports`

Customize where path models are generated to and imported from by modifying the configuration in the `gen.yaml` file.

Configuration like what is shown will result in a file structure as above.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(6:13)
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ...
typescript:
  version: 1.0.0
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models/callbacks
      errors: models/errors
      operations: models/operations
      shared: models/components
      webhooks: models/webhooks
  # ...
```

---

### !!steps `option`

The `option` key determines the type of bucketing scheme that is used for the models.

Only `openapi` is currently supported. This will bucket models into `components`, `operations`, `errors`, `callbacks`, and `webhooks` directories.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(7)
```

---

### !!steps `paths`

The `paths` section contains a map of bucket names to paths relative to the root of the generated SDK.

- `shared` refers to the models generated from the `components` section of the OpenAPI specification. (Note: `shared` is a legacy name for the bucket, retained for backward compatibility.)
- `operations` refers to the models generated for the request and responses of operations in the OpenAPI specification.
- `errors` refers to the models generated for schemas referenced in error status codes responses.
- `callbacks` refers to models generated for schemas within the `callbacks` section of an operation.
- `webhooks` refers to models generated from the `webhooks` section of an OpenAPI 3.1 document.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(8:13)
```

</ScrollyCoding>

You can customize these paths to any path that exists relative to the root of the SDK.

<Callout title="CAUTION" variant="warning">
  If you are providing custom path names, make sure there is no conflict with
  any of the existing directories in the SDK. Conflicts will result in
  compilation issues.
</Callout>

Different buckets can also be configured to use the same path, for example:

```yaml gen.yaml
typescript:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models
      errors: models
      operations: models
      shared: models
      webhooks: models
```

This will result in all models being generated to the `models` directory. The generator will then resolve any class name conflicts by prefixing or suffixing class names to ensure they are unique.

## Customize global imports

You can configure the generator to work with a global import path for all models.

For example:

```typescript
import { User, GetDrinkRequest, SDK } from '@speakeasy/bar'
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { SDK } from '@speakeasy/bar'
import { User } from '@speakeasy/bar/dist/models/components/user'
import { GetDrinkRequest } from '@speakeasy/bar/dist/models/operations/user'
```

You will configure global imports slightly differently for different languages:

For TypeScript to configure global imports, the `imports` section of your `gen.yaml` needs to include the following:

```yaml gen.yaml
typescript:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models
      errors: models
      operations: models
      shared: models
      webhooks: models

# OR

typescript:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: ""
      errors: ""
      operations: ""
      shared: ""
      webhooks: ""
```

For global imports in TypeScript, models will always be generated to the `models` directory, regardless of whether the `""` or `"models"` path is specified. However, global imports will only kick in if one of these two values is used for all buckets. This is to ensure the root directory isn&apos;t cluttered with files.

The configuration example above will result in a directory structure like this:

```yaml
/
├─ src
│  ├─ models/
│  │  ├─ user.ts
│  │  ├─ drink.ts
│  │  ├─ getuser.ts
│  │  ├─ updateuser.ts
│  │  ├─ getdrink.ts
│  │  ├─ updatedrink.ts
│  │  ├─ sdkerror.ts
│  │  ├─ responseerror.ts
│  │  ├─ index.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ ...
└─ ...
```

Import models like so:

```typescript
import { User, GetDrinkRequest, SDK } from '@speakeasy/bar'
```

For Python to configure global imports, the `imports` section of your `gen.yaml` needs to include the following:

```yaml gen.yaml
python:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models
      errors: models
      operations: models
      shared: models
      webhooks: models

# OR

python:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: ""
      errors: ""
      operations: ""
      shared: ""
      webhooks: ""
```

For global imports in Python, models will always be generated to the `models` directory, regardless of whether the `""` or `"models"` path is specified. However, global imports will only kick in if one of these two values is used for all buckets. This is to ensure the root directory isn&apos;t cluttered with files.

The configuration example above will result in a directory structure as follows:

```yaml
/
├─ src
│  ├─ sdk/
│  │  ├─ models/
│  │  |  ├─ user.py
│  │  │  ├─ drink.py
│  │  │  ├─ getuser.py
│  │  │  ├─ updateuser.py
│  │  │  ├─ getdrink.py
│  │  │  ├─ updatedrink.py
│  │  │  ├─ sdkerror.py
│  │  │  ├─ responseerror.py
│  │  │  └─ __init__.py
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ ...
└─ ...
```

Import like so:

```python
import speakeasybar
```

Instead of:

```python
import speakeasybar
from speakeasybar.models import operations, components
```

For Go to configure global imports, the `imports` section of your `gen.yaml` needs to include the following:

```yaml gen.yaml
go:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: ""
      errors: ""
      operations: ""
      shared: ""
      webhooks: ""
```

This configuration will instruct the generator to create models at the root of the SDK and result in the following directory structure:

```yaml
/
├─ user.go
├─ drink.go
├─ getuser.go
├─ updateuser.go
├─ getdrink.go
├─ updatedrink.go
├─ sdkerror.go
├─ responseerror.go
└─ ...
```

Note: This configuration will result in the root directory being cluttered with files.

Import models like so:

```go
import (
  "github.com/speakeasy/bar"
)
```

Instead of:

```go
import (
  "github.com/speakeasy/bar"
  "github.com/speakeasy/bar/models/operations"
  "github.com/speakeasy/bar/models/components"
)
```

For C# to configure global imports, the `imports` section of your `gen.yaml` needs to include the following:

```yaml gen.yaml
csharp:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: Models
      errors: Models
      operations: Models
      shared: Models
      webhooks: Models

# OR

csharp:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: ""
      errors: ""
      operations: ""
      shared: ""
      webhooks: ""
```

For global imports in C#, models will always be generated to the `Models` directory, regardless of whether the `""` or `"Models"` path is specified. However, global imports will only kick in if one of these two values is used for all buckets. This is to ensure the root directory isn&apos;t cluttered with files.

The above configuration will result in a directory structure like this:

```yaml
/
├─ {{packageName}}/
│  ├─ Models/
│  │  ├─ User.cs
│  │  ├─ Drink.cs
│  │  ├─ GetUserRequest.cs
│  │  ├─ GetUserResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateUserRequest.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateUserResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ GetDrinkRequest.cs
│  │  ├─ GetDrinkResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateDrinkRequest.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateDrinkResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ SDKError.cs
│  │  ├─ ResponseError.cs
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ ...
└─ ...
```

As all the models will be under the root namespace of the SDK, import models like so:

```csharp
using SpeakeasyBar;
```

For Unity to configure global imports, the `imports` section of your `gen.yaml` needs to include the following:

```yaml gen.yaml
unity:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: Models
      errors: Models
      operations: Models
      shared: Models
      webhooks: Models

# OR

unity:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: ""
      errors: ""
      operations: ""
      shared: ""
      webhooks: ""
```

For global imports in Unity, models will always be generated to the `Models` directory, regardless of whether the `""` or `"Models"` path is specified. However, global imports will only kick in if one of these two values is used for all buckets. This is to ensure the root directory isn&apos;t cluttered with files.

The configuration example above will result in a directory structure like this:

```yaml
/
├─ {{packageName}}/
│  ├─ Models/
│  │  ├─ User.cs
│  │  ├─ Drink.cs
│  │  ├─ GetUserRequest.cs
│  │  ├─ GetUserResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateUserRequest.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateUserResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ GetDrinkRequest.cs
��  │  ├─ GetDrinkResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateDrinkRequest.cs
│  │  ├─ UpdateDrinkResponse.cs
│  │  ├─ SDKError.cs
│  │  ├─ ResponseError.cs
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ ...
└─ ...
```

As all the models will be under the root namespace of the SDK, import models like so:

```csharp
using SpeakeasyBar;
```

<Callout title="CAUTION" variant="warning">
Global imports will cause namespace pollution for the import and file clutter in the directory models are generated to.

Large APIs containing many models (especially many inline models) will inevitably lead to name conflicts. Rename types verbosely to ensure each class is unique within the namespace.
