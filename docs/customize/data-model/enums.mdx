# Customize enums

## Enum value naming

### Basic conversion

Enum values are named according to their values, with adjustments made to form valid identifiers:

* Invalid characters are removed.
* Values are converted to fit the case style of the target programming language.
* Special characters (for example, `+`, `-`, and `.`) are converted to words (like `Plus`, `Minus`, and `Dot`).

### Name conflicts

If naming conflicts arise after sanitization, deduplication is attempted by modifying case styles or adding suffixes.

For example, given the following schema:

```yaml
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - foo
    - Foo
    - FOO
```

Resulting enum values will be `FOO_LOWER`, `FOO_MIXED`, and `FOO_UPPER`.

If unique names cannot be resolved, a validation error will prompt you to resolve conflicts, potentially using the `x-speakeasy-enums` extension.


```yaml
schema:
  type: integer
  enum:
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
  x-speakeasy-enums:
    - NOT_STARTED
    - IN_PROGRESS
    - COMPLETE
```

Ensure the order in the enum array corresponds to the custom names in the `x-speakeasy-enums` array.

## Enum class naming

Use the `x-speakeasy-name-override` attribute to customize enum class names:

```yaml
  Enum:
      x-speakeasy-name-override: example_override
      type: string
      enum:
        - foo
        - FOO
```

This schema will produce: 

```python
class ExampleOverride(str, Enum):
    FOO_LOWER = 'foo'
    FOO_UPPER = 'FOO'
```

### Name conflict considerations

Some cases (like open enums) may pose unique name resolutions challenges, particularly when similar names occur in the schema. 

In name conflict cases, the parent schema is given the original name, while the child schema's name is concatenated with the parent's name.

For example, the following schema:

```yaml
enum_field:
  oneOf:
    - type: string
    - type: string
      enum:
        - foo
        - FOO
      x-speakeasy-name-override: enum_field
```

Results in: 

```python
class EnumFieldEnumField(str, Enum):
  FOO_LOWER = 'value'
  FOO_UPPER = 'value'
```

To avoid naming conflicts, additional overrides may be necessary. For example:

```yaml
enum_field:
  x-speakeasy-name-override: enum_field_parent
          oneOf:
            - type: string
            - type: string
              enum:
                - foo
                - Foo
              x-speakeasy-name-override: enum_field
```

This will result in: 

```python
class EnumField(str, Enum):
  FOO_LOWER = 'value'
  FOO_UPPER = 'value'
```

## Open vs closed enums

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
This feature is currently supported in Go, Python, TypeScript, and Java SDKs.
</Callout>

By default, enums defined in OpenAPI are considered closed during code
generation. This means that introducing a new member to an enum can become a
breaking change for consumers of older versions of the SDK. Sometimes, this is
desirable because particular enums can be rigidly defined and not changing in
the foreseeable future (country codes might be a good example of this).

However, in some cases, you might want to make room for future iteration and the
introduction of new enum members. This is where open enums can help. Use the
`x-speakeasy-unknown-values` extension to mark an enum as open:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    BackgroundColor:
      type: string
      x-speakeasy-unknown-values: allow
      enum:
        - red
        - green
        - blue
```

When an SDK is generated with this type, the API is able to send values beyond
what is specified in the enum and these will be captured and returned to the user
in a type-safe manner. 

Here's an example of what this schema looks like in TypeScript:

```typescript
type BackgroundColor = 'red' | 'green' | 'blue' | Unrecognized<string>;
```

## Native enums vs union of strings

Languages like Python and TypeScript support string or integer literal unions as
well as native enum types. When generating SDKs for these targets, specify
the preferred style using the `enumFormat` option in the
`.speakeasy/gen.yaml` config file where the SDK is generated.

For example, in the `gen.yaml` file:

```yaml
typescript:
  enumFormat: union
```

This will cause all enums to be generated as a union of strings:

```typescript
type Color = "sky-blue" | "dark-gray" | "stone";
```

```typescript
import { SDK } from "cool-sdk";

const sdk = new SDK();

const result = await sdk.themes.create({
    name: "flashy",
    background: "dark-gray",
});
```

Whereas this:

```yaml
typescript:
  enumFormat: enum
```

Will result in the following output:

```typescript
enum Color {
  SkyBlue = 'sky-blue',
  DarkGray = 'dark-gray',
  Stone = 'stone',
}
```

```typescript
import { SDK } from "cool-sdk";
import { Color } from "cool-sdk/models/color";

const sdk = new SDK();

const result = await sdk.themes.create({
    name: "flashy",
    background: Color.DarkGray,
});
```

The main trade-offs to consider between the two styles are that literal unions
do not require SDK users to import any additional types or values from the SDK
package. The user starts typing a string or number and their IDE's autocompletion
interface will suggest from the valid set of values. 

Native enums need to be
imported from within the SDK but benefit from having members with clear names
and documentation on each. This is particularly useful when you define enums
that do not map well to spoken language, such as `enum: ["+", "_", "*", "!"]`.
Using the `x-speakeasy-enums` extension will allow you to customise the name of
each native enum member.

In TypeScript and Python, native enums are nominally typed, which means that
users cannot pass in any string value they have or another native enum that
overlaps with the desired one without triggering a type-checker error. In some
of these instances, they may need to write some code to map values to native
enum members.

### Mixing enum formats

While `enumFormat` is a global setting, it is possible to mix and match the enum
format on a per-schema basis using the `x-speakeasy-enum-format` extension:

```yaml
# `enumFormat` is set to `union` in the gen.yaml
components:
  schemas:
    BackgroundColor:
      type: int
      x-speakeasy-enum-format: enum
      enum:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
      x-speakeasy-enums:
        - Red
        - Green
        - Blue
```

In this case, the `BackgroundColor` enum will be generated as a native enum in
the target language, while the rest of the enums will be generated as a union of
values.
