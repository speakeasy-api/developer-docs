# Use Custom HTTP Clients

SDK users can provide a custom HTTP client when initializing SDKs. This is useful for modifying or debugging requests and responses in flight.

See below for per-language examples:

<CodeWithTabs>

```go !!tabs Go
/* The Go SDK will accept a client that implements a `Do(*http.Request) (*http.Response, error)` method similar to the standard library&apos;s `http.Client`. */

// A custom HTTP client that implements caching
c := NewCachedClient(&http.Client{}, cache)

opts := []sdk.SDKOption{
    sdk.WithClient(c),
}

s := sdk.New(opts)
```

{/* TODO: Make sure mark is working */}
```python !!tabs Python mark=7 
# The Python SDK will accept any client that implements the `HttpClient` interface from the SDK. Here&apos;s an example using the [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library:


import requests
from sdk import SDK, HttpClient

# Define a custom HTTP client using Requests
class RequestsHttpClient(HttpClient):
    def __init__(self):
        self.session = requests.Session()

    def send(self, request, **kwargs):
        return self.session.send(request.prepare())

    def build_request(
        self,
        method,
        url,
        *,
        content = None,
        headers = None,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        return requests.Request(
            method=method,
            url=url,
            data=content,
            headers=headers,
        )

# Initialize the custom client
client = RequestsHttpClient()

# Initialize the SDK with the custom client
sdk = SDK(client=client)

# Use the SDK client
res = sdk.method_name()
```

```typescript !!tabs TypeScript
/* The TypeScript SDK makes API calls using an `HTTPClient` that wraps the native[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). This client is a thin wrapper around `fetch` and provides the ability to attach hooks around the request lifecycle that can be used to modify the request or handleerrors and response. */


import { SDK } from "openapi";
import { HTTPClient } from "openapi/lib/http";

// Create an HTTPClient instance with the default fetcher
const httpClient = new HTTPClient({
   // fetcher takes a function that has the same signature as native `fetch`.
  fetcher: async (request) => fetch(request),
});

httpClient.addHook("requestError", (err) => {
  console.log(`Request failed: ${err}`);
});

// Initialize the SDK with the custom HTTP client
const sdk = new SDK({ httpClient });

```


```java !!tabs Java
/* The Java SDK will accept a client that implements the `HTTPClient` interface in the `utils` package. This will wrap a `java.net.http.HttpClient` instance and the call to `send`. */

// Custom HTTP client
YouHttpClient client = new YourHttpClient();

SDK.Builder builder = SDK.builder();

builder.setClient(client);

SDK sdk = builder.build();
```

```csharp !!tabs C#
/* YourHttpClient must implement the ISpeakeasyHttpClient interface */

var httpClient = new YourHttpClient();
// Initialize the SDK with the custom HTTP client
var sdk = new SDK(client: httpClient);
```
