# Custom code regions in Python

To enable custom code regions for Python SDKs, update the project's
`.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file like so:

```diff .speakeasy/gen.yaml
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ...
python:
  # ...
+ enableCustomCodeRegions: true
```

## Full example

The Speakeasy examples repository has a [full example](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/examples/tree/main/customcode-sdkclasses-python) of a Python SDK
that uses custom code regions.


## Regions

Below are the available code regions in Python SDKs.

### SDK classes

Python SDK classes can have two code regions:

* `# region imports` - allows the addition of imports to an SDK file needed for
custom methods and properties. This region must be located at the top of the
file alongside generated imports.
* `# region sdk-class-body` - allows the addition of custom methods and
properties to an SDK class. This region must be located in the body of a Python
SDK class alongside generated methods and properties.

## Managing dependencies

When adding custom code that requires external packages, you'll need to configure these dependencies in your `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file to prevent them from being removed during SDK regeneration. Use the `additionalDependencies` configuration to specify your package dependencies:

```yaml .speakeasy/gen.yaml
python:
  additionalDependencies:
    main:
      markdown: "^3.4.0"
      beautifulsoup4: "^4.12.0"
    dev:
      pytest: "^7.0.0"
      black: "^23.0.0"
```

This ensures your dependencies persist across SDK regenerations and are properly included in the generated `pyproject.toml`.

        return markdown.markdown(f"# {todo.title}\n\n{todo.description}")

    # endregion sdk-class-body

    def get_one(
        self,
        *,
        id: int,
        retries: OptionalNullable[utils.RetryConfig] = UNSET,
        server_url: Optional[str] = None,
        timeout_ms: Optional[int] = None,
        http_headers: Optional[Mapping[str, str]] = None,
    ) -> models.Todo:
        ...


    async def get_one_async(
        self,
        *,
        id: int,
        retries: OptionalNullable[utils.RetryConfig] = UNSET,
        server_url: Optional[str] = None,
        timeout_ms: Optional[int] = None,
        http_headers: Optional[Mapping[str, str]] = None,
    ) -> models.Todo:
        ...
```
