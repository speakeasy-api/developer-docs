# Additional index exports

To export additional modules, such as utilities and constants, from the main `index.ts` file of the SDK:

As Speakeasy generates the contents of `src/index.ts`, do not edit that file directly.

Instead, create an `index.extras.ts` file in the `src/` directory to define additional exports from the index file (`src/index.ts`) of the SDK.

If an `index.extras.ts` file is present, the SDK generator will automatically re-export its contents from the main `index.ts` file:

```ts <sdk-root>/src/index.ts
// { Speakeasy generated exports }

export * from "./index.extras.ts";
```
