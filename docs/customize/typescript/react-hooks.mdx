# Generating React Hooks from OpenAPI

Speakeasy can optionally generate React Hooks as part of your TypeScript SDK. React Hooks are built from your OpenAPI document using TanStack Query (formerly React Query), making it easier to build web applications that interact with your API.

<Callout title="Availability" type="info">
  Generated React Query hooks are available as part of the Speakeasy [business
  tier](/pricing).
</Callout>

## How to generate React Hooks from an OpenAPI document

Follow these steps to generate React Hooks from your OpenAPI document:

### Install the Speakeasy CLI

If you haven't already, install the Speakeasy CLI:

<CodeWithTabs>
```bash !!tabs Homebrew
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install speakeasy-api/tap/speakeasy
```

```bash !!tabs Script
# Script Installation (macOS and Linux)
curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh
```

```bash !!tabs Winget
# Windows Installation
# Using winget:
winget install speakeasy
```

```bash !!tabs Chocolatey
# Using Chocolatey:
choco install speakeasy
```

</CodeWithTabs>

### Generate a TypeScript SDK

If you haven't already generated a TypeScript SDK, run this command:

```bash
# For first-time SDK generation
speakeasy quickstart
```

Then, follow the prompts to select TypeScript as your target language and complete the SDK configuration.

### Enable React Hooks

Open the `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file in your SDK directory and add the `enableReactQuery` flag to it:

```yaml
typescript:
  version: x.y.z
  # ... other options
  enableReactQuery: true # Add this line to enable React hooks
```

### Regenerate your SDK with React Hooks

Navigate to the folder that holds the generated SDK and run the following command:

```bash
speakeasy run
```

This adds a new `src/react-query` directory, which contains all the generated React Hooks, to your SDK.

### Install the SDK in your application

Once you've generated your SDK with React Hooks, you need to install it in your React application.

- If you've published your SDK to a package registry like npm, install it directly:

<CodeWithTabs>
  ```bash !!tabs npm
  npm install your-sdk-package
  ```

  ```bash !!tabs yarn
  yarn add your-sdk-package
  ```

  ```bash !!tabs pnpm
  pnpm add your-sdk-package
  ```
</CodeWithTabs>

- Alternatively, if you're working with a local SDK, use the package manager's local path installation feature:

<CodeWithTabs>
    ```bash !!tabs npm
    npm install ../path/to/your-sdk
    ```

  ```bash !!tabs yarn
  yarn add ../path/to/your-sdk
  ```

  ```bash !!tabs pnpm
  pnpm add ../path/to/your-sdk
  ```
</CodeWithTabs>

## How to use the generated React Hooks

Before using React Hooks, you need to install their dependencies and configure your React Query provider.

### Install required dependencies

The generated SDK with React Hooks has TanStack Query and Zod dependencies that should be listed in the SDK's `package.json`. However, you might need to install them explicitly in your application:

<CodeWithTabs>
```bash !!tabs npm
npm install @tanstack/react-query zod
```

```bash !!tabs yarn
yarn add @tanstack/react-query zod
```

```bash !!tabs pnpm
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query zod
```

</CodeWithTabs>

<Callout title="Note">
  The Speakeasy-generated TypeScript SDK uses Zod for runtime type validation,
  and TanStack Query powers the React hooks. These dependencies are required for
  the SDK to function correctly.
</Callout>

### Set up the React Query provider

Add the TanStack Query provider to your React application:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

// Create a client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

## Basic usage

You can use the generated Hooks in your components as follows:

```tsx
import { useProductsGetById } from "your-sdk/react-query";

function ProductDetail({ productId }) {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useProductsGetById(productId);

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
      <p>${data.price}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## How to customize React Hooks

The default naming convention for React Hooks follows the standalone function naming convention. For example, a standalone function called `productsGetById` will have a corresponding React Hook called `useProductsGetById`.

Sometimes, these names are not ideal for React Hooks. In those instances, you can use the `x-speakeasy-react-hook` OpenAPI extension to override the default name:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /products/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: getById
      tags: [products]
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        name: Product
      # ...
```

With the example above, the React Hook will be called by `useProduct` and, under the hood, it will use the `productsGetById` standalone function.

### Generate queries and mutations

By default, the `GET`, `HEAD`, and `QUERY` operations generate React Query hooks, while other operations generate mutation hooks. This isn't always correct, since certain operations may be "read" operations exposed under the `POST` endpoint. A great example of this is the complex search APIs that take a request body with filters and other arguments.

You can override these OpenAPI operations with the `x-speakeasy-react-hook` extension so that they come out as React Query hooks:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /search/products:
    post:
      operationId: productsSearch
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        name: Search
        type: query
      # ...
```

### Disable React Hooks for an operation

React Hooks may not be useful or relevant for all operations in the API. Disable React Hook generation for an operation by setting the `disabled` flag under the `x-speakeasy-react-hook` extension:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /admin/reports:
    post:
      operationId: generateReport
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        disabled: true
      # ...
```

## Advanced usage

You can also use React Hooks for more advanced purposes.

### Implement optimistic updates

When using mutation hooks, you can use TanStack Query's optimistic update capabilities:

```tsx
import { useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import {
  useProductsGetById,
  useProductsUpdate,
} from "your-sdk-package/dist/react-query";

function EditProduct({ productId }) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const { data: product } = useProductsGetById(productId);
  const { mutate, isLoading } = useProductsUpdate({
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      // Invalidate and refetch
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(["products", productId]);
    },
  });

  const handleSubmit = (updatedData) => {
    // Optimistically update to the new value
    queryClient.setQueryData(["products", productId], updatedData);

    // Then update on the server
    mutate({
      id: productId,
      data: updatedData,
    });
  };

  // Component implementation
}
```

### Customize configurations

You can pass custom TanStack Query options to your hooks:

```tsx
const { data } = useProductsGetById(productId, {
  // Query options
  refetchInterval: 5000, // Refetch every 5 seconds
  staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // Consider data fresh for 5 minutes
  retry: 3, // Retry failed requests 3 times
});
```

### Use infinite queries for pagination

For paginated endpoints, you can use infinite React Query hooks:

```tsx
import { useProductsListInfinite } from "your-sdk-package/dist/react-query";

function ProductsList() {
  const { data, fetchNextPage, hasNextPage, isFetching } =
    useProductsListInfinite({ limit: 10 });

  return (
    <div>
      {data?.pages.map((page, i) => (
        <React.Fragment key={i}>
          {page.products.map((product) => (
            <ProductItem key={product.id} product={product} />
          ))}
        </React.Fragment>
      ))}

      <button
        onClick={() => fetchNextPage()}
        disabled={!hasNextPage || isFetching}
      >
        {isFetching
          ? "Loading more..."
          : hasNextPage
            ? "Load More"
            : "No more results"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
