# React hooks with TanStack Query

<Callout title="Availability" type="info">
  React hooks are available for [Business and Enterprise users](/pricing). You
  can trial this feature when you first sign up or [reach out](mailto:support@speakeasy.com) to us
  to get access.
</Callout>

In addition to the core SDK, it is possible to generate React hooks that help
supercharge users building web applications with the APIs.

To get started, update the `gen.yaml` file to enable this feature:

```yaml <sdk-root>/.speakeasy/gen.yaml
typescript:
  enableReactQuery: true
  # other Typescript configuration options...
```

## Customizing React hooks

The default naming convention for React hooks follows that of standalone
functions. For example, a standalone function called `productsGetById` will have
a corresponding React hook called `useProductsGetById`.

Sometimes, these names are not ideal for React hooks. In those instances, the
`x-speakeasy-react-hook` OpenAPI extension can be used to override the name:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /products/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: getById
      tags: [products] 
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        name: Product
      # ...
```

With the example above, the React hook will be called `useProduct` and under the
hood, it will use the `productsGetById` standalone function.

### Queries and mutations

By default, `GET` / `HEAD` / `QUERY` operations will result in React query hooks
being generated while other operations will result in mutation hooks. This isn't
always correct since certain operations may be "read" operations exposed under
`POST` endpoint. A great example of this is complex search APIs that take a
request body with filters and other arguments. Override these OpenAPI
operations to come out as query hooks using the `x-speakeasy-react-hook`
extension: 

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /search/products:
    post:
      operationId: productsSearch
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        name: Search
        type: query
      # ...
```

### Disabling React hooks for an operation

React hooks may not be useful or relevant for all operations in the API. 
Disable React hooks generation for an operation by setting the `disabled`
flag under the `x-speakeasy-react-hook` extension:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /admin/reports:
    post:
      operationId: generateReport
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        disabled: true
      # ...
```
