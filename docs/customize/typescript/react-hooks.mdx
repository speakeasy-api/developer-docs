# React hooks with TanStack Query

<Callout title="Availability" variant="info">
  React hooks are available for [Business and Enterprise users](/pricing). You
  can trial this feature when you first sign up or [reach out][contact] to us
  to get access.

  [contact]: mailto:support@speakeasy.com
</Callout>

In addition to the core SDK, you can also generate React hooks that can help
supercharge users building web applications with your APIs.

To get started, update your `gen.yaml` file to enable this feature:

```yaml <sdk-root>/.speakeasy/gen.yaml
typescript:
  enableReactQuery: true
  # other Typescript configuration options...
```

## Customising React hooks

The default naming convention for React hooks follows that of standalone
functions. For example, a standalone function called `productsGetById` will have
a corresponding React hook called `useProductsGetById`.

Sometimes, these names are not ideal for React hooks. In those instances, the
`x-speakeasy-react-hook` OpenAPI extension can be used to override the name:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /products/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: getById
      tags: [products] 
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        name: Product
      # ...
```

With the example above, the React hook will be called `useProduct` and under the
hood, it will use the `productsGetById` standalone function.

### Queries and mutations

By default, `GET` / `HEAD` / `QUERY` operations will result in React query hooks
being generated while other operations will result in mutation hooks. This isn't
always correct since certain operations may be "read" operations exposed under
`POST` endpoint. A great example of this is complex search APIs that take a
request body with filters and other arguments. You can override these OpenAPI
operations to come out as query hooks using the `x-speakeasy-react-hook`
extension: 

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /search/products:
    post:
      operationId: productsSearch
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        name: Search
        type: query
      # ...
```

### Disabling React hooks for an operation

React hooks may not be useful or relevant for all operations in your API. You
can disable React hooks generation for an operation by setting the `disabled`
flag under the `x-speakeasy-react-hook` extension:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /admin/reports:
    post:
      operationId: generateReport
      x-speakeasy-react-hook:
        disabled: true
      # ...
```
