# Testing in GitHub Actions

Automatically run Speakeasy tests on SDK pull requests or other events in a GitHub repository via GitHub Actions.

## Setting up a Github Actions Check

This requires previously completing the [Github Setup](/docs/manage/github-setup).
After completing the setup, navigate to the SDK repository and run the following command:

```bash
# It's okay to run this command multiple times if you have already configured tests locally
speakeasy configure tests
```

This command enables both `generateTests` and `generateNewTests` settings in your [`gen.yaml`](/docs/speakeasy-reference/generation/gen-yaml) configuration file and produces a Github Actions workflow like the following that enables running SDK tests as a Github check on Pull Requests.

```yaml
name: Test SDKs
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      target:
        description: Specific target to test
        type: string
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "**"
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/sdk-test.yaml@v15
    with:
      target: ${{ github.event.inputs.target }}
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

## Ensuring Tests Run on Automated PR Creation

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">

Pull requests created by the action using the default GITHUB_TOKEN cannot trigger other workflows.
When you have on: pull_request or on: push workflows acting as checks on pull requests, they will not run by default.

</Callout>

To ensure that testing checks run by default when an SDK PR is created, implement one of the following options.

### Installing the Speakeasy Github App

Installing the Speakeasy Github App and granting the App access to the SDK repository enables triggering testing runs after a PR is created.
To install the app, visit this [link](https://github.com/apps/speakeasy-github) or follow instructions in the CLI or dashboard.

### Setting up your own Github PAT

Another option is to create a Github Personal Access Token (PAT) that will be used to create PRs in the SDK repository.
This is a workaround [recommended](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow) by Github.

1. Create a [fine-grained](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) PAT with `Pull requests Read/Write` permissions. Ensure it has access to the SDK repository. Setting this to no expiration is recommended.

  }}
/>

  variant="web"
  url="github.com"
  image={{
    src: "/assets/docs/configure-github/pr-pat-part3.png",
    alt: "Pull request permissions",
  }}
/>

2. In all SDK repositories, navigate to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` and save the PAT as a Repository secret under the name `PR_CREATION_PAT`.

<Screenshot
  variant="web"
  url="github.com"
  image={{
    src: "/assets/docs/configure-github/pr-creation-token.png",
    alt: "Providing access to a specific repo",
  }}
/>

3. In all sdk_generation.yaml workflows, add the `pr-creation-token` as a provided secret at the bottom.

```yaml
secrets:
  github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
  pr_creation_pat: ${{ secrets.PR_CREATION_PAT }}
```

## Running in Direct mode

If your generation action is running in `direct` mode where SDK updates get immediately pushed to main, testing will run as part of the generation action.
If tests fail, the generation action will fail and not push your SDK changes to main.
