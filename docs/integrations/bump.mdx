# Integrate Speakeasy with Bump.sh

---



Bump.sh is a hosted solution for simple API documentation, API catalogs, and API explorers, which makes it a great tool to use in conjunction with [Speakeasy's Automated Code Samples feature](/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls). Embed SDKs right into the API documentation, making it easier for developers to get started with the API.

  }}
/>

## Prerequisites

To integrate Bump.sh with Speakeasy, you'll need the following:

 - A Bump.sh account. Sign up at [https://bump.sh/users/sign_up](https://bump.sh/users/sign_up).
 - A Speakeasy-generated SDK with a configured [automated code sample URL](/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls).



## Setting up the integration

<GetPublicUrlSnippet />

### Import the combined spec URL into Bump.sh

In the Bump.sh dashboard, either create **New Documentation** or open existing API documentation. Click **Settings** and open the **Automatic Deployment** tab.

  }}
/>

Select whether you want to deploy via GitHub Actions or CLI, and copy the appropriate example, which will include the Doc ID and the API token for you.

If you're new to Bump.sh, start with the CLI. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g bump-cli

bump deploy https://spec.speakeasy.com/walker/walker/book-club-oas-with-code-samples
  --token=<your-api-token>
  --doc=<your-doc-id>
```

When the import is complete, the API documentation will be rendered, and Speakeasy-generated code samples will be embedded in the relevant OpenAPI operations.

  }}
/>

## Next steps

For more advanced configurations than this basic setup, refer to the [Bump.sh and Speakeasy integration guide](https://docs.bump.sh/guides/bump-sh-tutorials/generate-sdks-with-speakeasy/), which demonstrates using GitHub Actions to automate deployments.

Bump.sh is more than just an OpenAPI renderer â€“ it also provides API catalogs, discovery tools, and interactive playgrounds. Learn more about Bump.sh in the [official documentation](https://docs.bump.sh/).
