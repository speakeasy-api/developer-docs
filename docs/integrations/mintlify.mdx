# Integrate Speakeasy With Mintlify

---

## Overview

Auto-generated code snippets from Speakeasy SDKs can be integrated directly into
Mintlify API reference documentation. SDK usage snippets are shown in the
[interactive playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of
Mintlify-powered documentation sites.

## Setting up the Integration

### Prerequisites

<Callout title="IMPORTANT" variant="warning">
  Before continuing with this guide, ensure that the following prerequisites
  have been met:
  <br />
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
    <li className="marker:content-['✓__']">
      {"An "}
      <a href="/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls">
        {"Automated Code Sample URL"}
      </a>
      {" has been configured for the desired Speakeasy SDK, and"}
    </li>
    <li className="marker:content-['✓__']">
      {"A "}
      <a href="https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart#creating-the-repository">
        {"Mintlify documentation repository"}
      </a>
      {" has been created."}
    </li>
  </ul>
  Once those requirements have been met, proceed with the following steps.
</Callout>

### Locate & Copy the Combined Spec URL

### Update Mintlify config, aka `mint.json`

OpenAPI specifications can be added to **Anchors**, or **Tabs** in the
`mint.json` file of a Mintlify repository. Anchors are displayed as a list of
links on the left side of the documentation, while Tabs are displayed as tabs on
the top of the documentation.

To add an OpenAPI specification to **Anchors**, update the `anhchor` field in
`mint.json` file with:

```json mint.json
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

To add an OpenAPI specification to **Tabs**, update the `tab` field in
`mint.json` file with:

```json mint.json
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "url": "api-reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL"
    }
  ]
}
```

Mintlify offers useful customizations for API references generated from OpenAPI
specifications. For more information on, refer to the [Mintlify
documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup).

## What Next?

After completing the steps above, code snippets generated by Speakeasy can be
viewed in the Mintlify API reference documentation. To see the code snippets in
action, navigate to the [interactive
playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of the
Mintlify-powered documentation site.
