# Integrate Speakeasy with Scalar

---



With **Scalar**, you can easily create and maintain API documentation. Scalar renders documentation by referencing a live OpenAPI document, making it compatible with [Speakeasy's Automated Code Samples feature](/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls).

## Prerequisites

To integrate Scalar with Speakeasy, you'll need the following:

- A Scalar account. Sign up at [https://dashboard.scalar.com/register](https://dashboard.scalar.com/register).
- A Speakeasy-generated SDK with a configured [automated code sample URL](/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls).

## Setting up the integration

### Import the combined spec URL into Scalar

Open a [Scalar project](https://docs.scalar.com), go to the **Reference** tab, and click **Import URL**.

Paste the combined spec URL copied from Speakeasy into the provided field, optionally check **Create Link**, then click **Import**.

When the import is complete, the API documentation will be rendered.
