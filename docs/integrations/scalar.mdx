# Integrate Speakeasy With Scalar

---

## Overview

**Scalar** makes creating and maintaining API documentation _very_ easy. It is
able to to render documentation by referencing a live OpenAPI spec, making it a
great tool to use in conjunction with [Speakeasy's Automated Code Samples
feature](/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls).

      <a href="/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls">
        {"Automated Code Sample URL"}
      </a>
      {" has been configured for the desired Speakeasy SDK, and"}
    </li>
    <li className="marker:content-['✓__']">
      {"Created an account on "} <a href="https://scalar.com">Scalar</a>
      {"."}
    </li>
  </ul>
  Once those requirements have been met, proceed with the following steps.
