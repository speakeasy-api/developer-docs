# Why API developer experience?

In 2011, following years of development, Stripe launched their Transactions API product and upturned conventional B2B product building. The Stripe API-first approach transformed how companies build and sell into enterprises. Lengthy sales and systems integrations have been replaced by developers making a simple `curl` request from their terminal. As Stripe took the world by storm, companies scrambled to redefine their interfaces and shift to an API-first strategy.

Fast-forward to today, and API products are everywhere. Most B2B companies expose their core functionality via API, yet their businesses haven't exploded like Stripe's did. **Poor developer experience still blocks the potential of offering your products as APIs.** API users are still held back by having to dig through unhelpful API reference pages and write scrolls of boilerplate code before they can even test out an API.

## Why choose Speakeasy?

Speakeasy is an infrastructure for building delightful API experiences. We focus on building foundational products that enable companies to construct awesome API experiences in a matter of minutes, not months.

- **Crafted experiences** – We believe great integration experiences come down to the details. We obsess over the little things so that you don't have to. Whether it's the ergonomics of iterating a paginated response or managing a complex OAuth flow, we've got you covered.
- **Best-in-class support as a feature** – We're your experts on call. Struggling with OpenAPI polymorphic types? No problem! We're ready to dive in with you. Reach out to us, and you'll always point in the direction that best suits your end users.
- **Prolific product velocity**  – We ship every day. We're constantly adding new features and improving our existing ones. Our [roadmap](https://speakeasy.productlane.com/roadmap) is public, and we're always looking for feedback.
- **Maximize your API spec** – You've probably already invested a lot of time in managing and documenting your API types. We believe nurturing your API spec and treating it like a first-class citizen can lead to great outcomes for everyone in your API lifecycle, whether internal or external to your organization. To that end, we've built a toolchain that will assist you in making API changes and iteration easy and foolproof.
- **Quality and reliability** – You're trusting us with key product surfaces. We take that responsibility seriously. We're committed to providing you with a reliable and high-quality product that you can ship with confidence.

## What is the product?

We're building toward a complete suite of tooling to make API development delightful. Our products are modular, so you can take what you want and leave what you don't. Here's the breakdown:

### Production-ready SDKs

Don't put the burden of API integration on your users. Provide idiomatic SDKs in 8+ languages, making API integration as easy as writing a single line of code. Speakeasy automatically creates SDKs from your OpenAPI spec that are:

- **Type safe** – Generated code is fully typed. The most complex APIs are mapped to the most idiomatic types in each language.
- **Idiomatic** – Generated code adheres to common language conventions. As the ecosystem evolves, you can trust dependencies will always stay up to date.
- **Human readable** – Generated code feels handcrafted, complete with comments and READMEs to make it easier for developers to read and debug.
- **Batteries included** – Packages include everything needed for an enterprise-grade integration, including authentication, error handling, retries, pagination, and more.

### Terraform providers

Make your API available as infrastructure. Annotate your OpenAPI spec and create providers that enable your users to:

- **Unlock multi-cloud use cases** - Companies are increasingly multi-cloud, and Terraform is the tool of choice for making your infrastructure cloud-agnostic.
- **Gain environment consistency** - Make your API available to your users consistently across all their environments.
- **Set up disaster recovery** - Enable customers to store state. In the event of a disaster, they can easily recover the resources managed via your API.

### SDK-first documentation

Move beyond curl. Too many APIs out there leave users hanging with a classic three-pane reference. These can look snazzy but rarely reduce the time to the first successful `200` response. 

We believe documentation should be SDK-first, not API-first. That's why our documentation focuses on what integrations look like in the API consumer's language of choice. Upload your OpenAPI spec to give your users docs that get them from zero to `200` fast, with:

- **Usage snippets** – Make your documentation rich with compilable code examples to help users get started. No examples? No problem.
- **Synced docs** – Sync the docs in your installable library, GitHub repo, and website for a consistent developer experience.
- **Sandboxes** – Enable users to test your API using SDKs directly from your docs.
