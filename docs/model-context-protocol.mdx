# How to generate MCP servers from OpenAPI

Speakeasy can generate [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers from your OpenAPI document, enabling integration with AI agents and tools that support MCP.

<Callout title="Beta" type="info">
  The MCP server feature is currently in `Beta`. The `Beta` tag indicates the
  maturity of MCP, which Anthropic is actively evolving. It does not reflect the
  maturity of Speakeasy code generation.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Availability" type="info">
  MCP servers are available as part of the Speakeasy [free tier](/pricing).
</Callout>

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol developed by Anthropic for defining tools, which is being adopted by many AI agent platforms, including the AI assistant, [Claude](https://claude.ai/download), and the code editor, [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). A [full list of MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) is available on the MCP site.

TypeScript SDKs generated with Speakeasy can optionally include an MCP server when explicitly enabled, allowing them to be integrated with any supported MCP client.

## How to generate an MCP server

Follow these steps to generate an MCP server from your OpenAPI document:

### Install the Speakeasy CLI

If you haven't already, install the Speakeasy CLI:

<CodeWithTabs>
```bash !!tabs Homebrew
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install speakeasy-api/homebrew-tap/speakeasy
```

```bash !!tabs Script
# Script Installation (macOS and Linux)
curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh
```

```bash !!tabs Winget
# Windows Installation
# Using winget:
winget install speakeasy
```

```bash !!tabs Chocolatey
# Using Chocolatey:
choco install speakeasy
```

</CodeWithTabs>

### Generate a TypeScript SDK

If you haven't already generated a TypeScript SDK, run this command:

```bash
# For first-time SDK generation
speakeasy quickstart
```

Then, follow the prompts to select TypeScript as your target language and complete the SDK configuration.

### Enable MCP server generation in your configuration

MCP server generation is **not enabled by default** for TypeScript SDKs. To generate an MCP server, open the `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file in your SDK directory and explicitly add the `enableMCPServer` flag:

```yaml
typescript:
  version: x.y.z
  responseFormat: flat # Currently required for MCP server generation
  enableMCPServer: true # Explicitly enable MCP server generation
  # ... other options
```

<Callout title="Requirements" type="info">
  MCP server generation must be explicitly enabled with `enableMCPServer: true` and is only supported for TypeScript SDKs using `responseFormat: flat`.
</Callout>

### Regenerate your SDK with an MCP server

Navigate to the folder that holds the TypeScript SDK and run the following command to regenerate your SDK with the MCP server:

```bash
speakeasy run
```

This adds a new `src/mcp-server` directory, which contains all the MCP server code, to your SDK:

```yaml
your-sdk/src/mcp-server
├── tools
│   ├── tool1.ts
│   ├── tool2.ts
│   ├── ...
├── build.mts
├── mcp-server.ts
├── resources.ts
├── server.ts
├── shared.ts
└── tools.ts
```

It also adds instructions for installing the server in a new section beneath the `SDK Installation` section in your `README.md` file, and adds a `bin` section to your `package.json` file, which points to the executable entry point for the server.

## How to use an MCP server

Now that you know how to generate an MCP server from an OpenAPI document, let's look at how you or your users might use one.

### Set up a basic MCP server

Here's an example of how to launch a basic MCP server defined in a `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "your-sdk-package", "mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `env` property makes environment variables available to the server, while the `args` after `start` allow you to customize specific attributes of the server.

### Use standalone binaries

MCP server standalone binaries are automatically built and added to GitHub releases for published SDKs:

```bash
curl -L -o mcp-server \
    https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/mcp-server-bun-darwin-arm64 && \
chmod +x mcp-server
```

If the repo is private, you must add your GitHub PAT to download a release:

```bash
curl -L -o mcp-server \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_PAT}" \
    https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/mcp-server-bun-darwin-arm64 && \
chmod +x mcp-server
```

Consider the following example configuration with a standalone binary:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "./path/to/mcp-server",
      "args": ["start"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Run MCP locally during development

For local development and testing, you can run the MCP server directly without publishing:

1. Make your changes to the SDK.
2. Execute `npm run build` to rebuild the MCP server (requires Node v20+).
3. Use this configuration to run it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/repo/bin/mcp-server.js", "start"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How to customize MCP tools

You can customize how your API operations are exposed as MCP tools using the `x-speakeasy-mcp` OpenAPI extension.

### Set the configuration options

The `x-speakeasy-mcp` extension can be used on any operation to customize the MCP tool:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /products:
    post:
      operationId: createProduct
      tags: [products]
      summary: Create product
      description: API endpoint for creating a product in the CMS
      x-speakeasy-mcp:
        disabled: false
        name: create-product
        scopes: [write, ecommerce]
        description: |
          Creates a new product using the provided form. The product name should
          not contain any special characters or harmful words.
      # ...
```

#### `disabled` <small>(_optional_, default: `false`)</small>

If set to `true`, the generator will not create the MCP tool for this operation.

#### `name` <small>(_optional_)</small>

This is the name of the MCP tool. The default value is derived from `operationId`, `tags`, `x-speakeasy-name-override`, and `x-speakeasy-name-group`. In the example above, the default name would be `products_create-product`.

#### `scopes` <small>(_optional_)</small>

You can use scopes to tag tools so that users can choose which set of tools they want to mount when the MCP server starts. For example, tagging relevant operations with a `read` scope allows users to start a server in read-only mode.

#### `description` <small>(_optional_)</small>

Each MCP tool description is passed as context to MCP clients and language models. The default value is the OpenAPI operation summary and description. It's a good practice to review and customize these descriptions for better context.

### Use overlays

[Overlays](/openapi/overlays) are a convenient way you can add the `x-speakeasy-mcp` extension to existing OpenAPI documents without modifying them. To create an Overlay file, you can use the Speakeasy [Overlay Playground](https://overlay.speakeasy.com/).

For example, you can add scopes based on HTTP methods:

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Add MCP scopes
  version: 0.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths.*["get","head","query"]
    update: { "x-speakeasy-mcp": { "scopes": ["read"] } }

  - target: $.paths.*["post","put","delete","patch"]
    update: { "x-speakeasy-mcp": { "scopes": ["write"] } }
```

## Advanced usage

More advanced uses of an MCP server include the following:

### Specify scopes at runtime

When starting the MCP server, you can specify which scopes to include:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "your-sdk-package", "mcp", "start", "--scope", "read"]
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example configuration only mounts tools tagged with the `read` scope, creating a read-only server.

### Specify individual tools

You can further limit the subset of tools mounted on an MCP server by specifying individual tool names:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "your-sdk-package", "mcp", "start", "--tool", "my_tool_1", "--tool", "my_tool_2"]
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Next steps

- Explore the list of [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) that you can integrate with your server
- Read about [AI agents](/mcp/ai-agents-intro) and how they can interact with your API
