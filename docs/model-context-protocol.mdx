# Generate MCP servers from OpenAPI/Swagger

<Callout title="Experimental" type="info">
  The MCP server feature is currently experimental. The AI tools ecosystem is
  nascent and we plan to keep iterating on it. There may be breaking changes for
  this feature within the minor/patch version ranges of a TypeScript SDK
  release.
</Callout>

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open source protocol developed by Anthropic for defining tools which is beginning to be adopted by many AI agent platforms like the
[Claude](https://claude.ai/download) desktop app or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) code editor. The full list of clients is available [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

TypeScript SDKs generated with Speakeasy include a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server which allows them to be integrated with by any supported client.

## Prerequisites

To turn on MCP server generation just set `enableMCPServer` to true in your `gen.yaml` file and regenerate your SDK on Github or by executing `speakeasy run` locally

<Callout title="Temporary restriction" type="info">
  MCP server generation is only supported for TypeScript SDKs using
  `responseFormat: flat`.

  ```yaml <sdk-root>/.speakeasy/gen.yaml
  # !focus(2)
  typescript:
    responseFormat: flat
    enableMCPServer: true
  ```

</Callout>

## What's generated

The MCP server code will live in a new folder generated in the SDK under `src/mcp-server`:

```yaml
bluesky-ts/src/mcp-server
├── tools
│   ├── accountDelete.ts
│   ├── accountExportData.ts
│   ├── accountsGetInviteCodes.ts
│   ├── actorGetSuggestions.ts
│   ├── ...
├── build.mts
├── mcp-server.ts
├── resources.ts
├── server.ts
├── shared.ts
└── tools.ts
```

Your `README.md` will also get a new section under the "SDK Installation" section with instructions on how to install the server and a `bin` section is added to `package.json` which points to the executable entrypoint for the server. This is what MCP client's install command will use.

## Configuring generated tools

The `x-speakeasy-mcp` OpenAPI extension can be used on any operation to
customize the MCP tool that will be generated for it. The extension is used like
this:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /products:
    post:
      operationId: createProduct
      tags: [products]
      summary: Create product
      description: API endpoint for creating a product in the CMS
      x-speakeasy-mcp:
        disabled: false
        name: create-product
        scopes: [write, ecommerce]
        description: |
          Creates a new product using the provided form. The product name should
          not contain any special characters or harmful words.
      requestBody:
        # ...
      responses:
        # ...
```

### `disabled` <small>(_optional_, default: `false`)</small>

If set to `true`, the generator will not create the MCP tool for this operation.

### `name` <small>(_optional_)</small>

The name of the MCP tool. The default value is derived from `operationId`,
`tags`, `x-speakeasy-name-override`, `x-speakeasy-name-group` and is usually
sufficient. In the example above, the default name of the tool would be
`products_create-product`.

### `scopes` <small>(_optional_)</small>

Scopes are a way to tag tools so that users can choose which set of tools they
want to mount when the MCP server starts. For example, tagging relevant
operations with a `read` scope will allow users to start a server in a read-only
mode. This adds a level of safety which prevents a client from accidentally
modifying or deleting data while exploring.


### `description` <small>(_optional_)</small>

The description of the MCP tool that is passed as context to a MCP clients and
language models. The default value for a tool's description is the OpenAPI
operation summary. In the example above, the description would be:

```
Create product

API endpoint for creating a product in the CMS
```

Often times, the default description may not have enough useful context so it's
a good idea to review generated descriptions and override them with this option.

### Using overlays

[Overlays](/openapi/overlays) are a convenient way to introduce the `x-speakeasy-mcp`
extension to existing OpenAPI documents. To easily create an Overlays file, you can use our [Overlay Playground](https://overlay.speakeasy.com/).

Example of adding scopes to operations based on the HTTP method:

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Add MCP scopes
  version: 0.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths.*["get","head","query"]
    update: { "x-speakeasy-mcp": { "scopes": ["read"] } }

  - target: $.paths.*["post","put","delete","patch"]
    update: { "x-speakeasy-mcp": { "scopes": ["write"] } }
```

## MCP Server Usage

Here's an example of how to launch a basic MCP server defined in a `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
Notice that the `env` property is used to make environment variables available to the server while args after `start` allow one to customize specific attributes of the server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Todos": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "todos", "mcp", "start"]
      "env": {
        "TODOS_API_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running Standalone Binaries

MCP server standalone binaries are automatically built and added to Github Releases for published SDKs.

```bash
curl -L -o mcp-server \
    https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/mcp-server-bun-darwin-arm64 && \
chmod +x mcp-server
```

If the repo is a private repo you must add your Github PAT to download a release `-H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_PAT}"`.


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Todos": {
      "command": "./DOWNLOAD/PATH/mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Running MCP Locally

Releasing an npm package every time one wants to test their custom changes can be very time-consuming. Luckily, it is relatively easy to directly run MCP server changes locally.

After each change, execute `npm run build` to rebuild the MCP server. Ensure you have **Node V20** or above installed.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Todos": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/repo/bin/mcp-server.js",
        "start"
      ],
      "env": {
        "TODOS_API_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Specifying Scopes

Scopes allows one to specify which set of tools they want to mount when the MCP server starts.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Todos": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "todos", "mcp", "start", "--scope", "read"]
      "env": {
        "TODOS_API_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Specifying Tools

One can further narrow the subset of tools mounted on an MCP server. This is done by passing specific tool names in via arguments.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Todos": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "todos", "mcp", "start", "--tool", "my_tool_1", "--tool", "my_tool_2"]
      "env": {
        "TODOS_API_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```
