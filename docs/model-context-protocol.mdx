# Generate MCP Servers from OpenAPI/Swagger

Speakeasy can generate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers from your OpenAPI specification, enabling integration with AI agents and tools that support MCP.

<Callout title="Beta" type="info">
  The MCP server feature is currently in `Beta`. The `Beta` tag indicates the
  maturity of the MCP protocol which Anthropic is actively evolving. it does not
  reflect the maturity of Speakeasy code generation.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Availability" type="info">
  MCP servers are available as part of the Speakeasy [free tier](/pricing).
</Callout>

## What is Model Context Protocol?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open source protocol developed by Anthropic for defining tools which is beginning to be adopted by many AI agent platforms like the [Claude](https://claude.ai/download) desktop app or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) code editor. The full list of clients is available [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

TypeScript SDKs generated with Speakeasy can include a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server which allows them to be integrated with any supported MCP client.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to generate an MCP server from your OpenAPI specification:

### 1. Install the Speakeasy CLI

If you haven't already, install the Speakeasy CLI:

<CodeWithTabs>
```bash !!tabs Homebrew
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install speakeasy-api/homebrew-tap/speakeasy
```

```bash !!tabs Script
# Script Installation (macOS and Linux)
curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh
```

```bash !!tabs Winget
# Windows Installation
# Using winget:
winget install speakeasy
```

```bash !!tabs Chocolatey
# Using Chocolatey:
choco install speakeasy
```
</CodeWithTabs>

### 2. Generate a TypeScript SDK

If you haven't already generated a TypeScript SDK, run:

```bash
# For first-time SDK generation
speakeasy quickstart
```

Follow the prompts to select TypeScript as your target language and complete the SDK configuration.

### 3. Enable MCP Server in Your Configuration

Open the `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file in your SDK directory and add the `enableMCPServer` flag:

```yaml
typescript:
  version: x.y.z
  responseFormat: flat # Currently required for MCP server generation
  enableMCPServer: true # Add this line to enable MCP server
  # ... other options
```

<Callout title="Temporary restriction" type="info">
  MCP server generation is only supported for TypeScript SDKs using
  `responseFormat: flat`.
</Callout>

### 4. Regenerate Your SDK with MCP Server

Navigate to the folder that holds the TypeScript SDK and run the following command to regenerate your SDK with the MCP server:

```bash
speakeasy run
```

This will add a new `src/mcp-server` directory to your SDK containing all the MCP server code:

```yaml
your-sdk/src/mcp-server
├── tools
│   ├── tool1.ts
│   ├── tool2.ts
│   ├── ...
├── build.mts
├── mcp-server.ts
├── resources.ts
├── server.ts
├── shared.ts
└── tools.ts
```

Your `README.md` will also get a new section under the "SDK Installation" section with instructions on how to install the server, and a `bin` section is added to `package.json` which points to the executable entrypoint for the server.

## Using the MCP Server

### Basic Setup

Here's an example of how to launch a basic MCP server defined in a `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "your-sdk-package", "mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `env` property is used to make environment variables available to the server, while args after `start` allow you to customize specific attributes of the server.

### Using Standalone Binaries

MCP server standalone binaries are automatically built and added to GitHub Releases for published SDKs:

```bash
curl -L -o mcp-server \
    https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/mcp-server-bun-darwin-arm64 && \
chmod +x mcp-server
```

If the repo is private, you must add your GitHub PAT to download a release:

```bash
curl -L -o mcp-server \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_PAT}" \
    https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/mcp-server-bun-darwin-arm64 && \
chmod +x mcp-server
```

Example configuration with standalone binary:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "./path/to/mcp-server",
      "args": ["start"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Running MCP Locally During Development

For local development and testing, you can run the MCP server directly without publishing:

1. Make your changes to the SDK
2. Execute `npm run build` to rebuild the MCP server (requires Node v20+)
3. Use this configuration to run it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/repo/bin/mcp-server.js", "start"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Customizing MCP Tools

You can customize how your API operations are exposed as MCP tools using the `x-speakeasy-mcp` OpenAPI extension.

### Configuration Options

The `x-speakeasy-mcp` extension can be used on any operation to customize the MCP tool:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /products:
    post:
      operationId: createProduct
      tags: [products]
      summary: Create product
      description: API endpoint for creating a product in the CMS
      x-speakeasy-mcp:
        disabled: false
        name: create-product
        scopes: [write, ecommerce]
        description: |
          Creates a new product using the provided form. The product name should
          not contain any special characters or harmful words.
      # ...
```

#### `disabled` <small>(_optional_, default: `false`)</small>

If set to `true`, the generator will not create the MCP tool for this operation.

#### `name` <small>(_optional_)</small>

The name of the MCP tool. The default value is derived from `operationId`, `tags`, `x-speakeasy-name-override`, and `x-speakeasy-name-group`. In the example above, the default name would be `products_create-product`.

#### `scopes` <small>(_optional_)</small>

Scopes are a way to tag tools so that users can choose which set of tools they want to mount when the MCP server starts. For example, tagging relevant operations with a `read` scope allows users to start a server in read-only mode.

#### `description` <small>(_optional_)</small>

The description of the MCP tool that is passed as context to MCP clients and language models. The default value is the OpenAPI operation summary and description. It's a good practice to review and customize these descriptions for better context.

### Using Overlays

[Overlays](/openapi/overlays) are a convenient way to add the `x-speakeasy-mcp` extension to existing OpenAPI documents without modifying them. To create an Overlays file, you can use the [Overlay Playground](https://overlay.speakeasy.com/).

Example of adding scopes based on HTTP methods:

```yaml overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Add MCP scopes
  version: 0.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths.*["get","head","query"]
    update: { "x-speakeasy-mcp": { "scopes": ["read"] } }

  - target: $.paths.*["post","put","delete","patch"]
    update: { "x-speakeasy-mcp": { "scopes": ["write"] } }
```

## Advanced Usage

### Specifying Scopes at Runtime

When starting the MCP server, you can specify which scopes to include:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "your-sdk-package", "mcp", "start", "--scope", "read"]
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration only mounts tools tagged with the "read" scope, creating a read-only server.

### Specifying Individual Tools

You can further narrow the subset of tools mounted on an MCP server by specifying individual tool names:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MyAPI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--", "your-sdk-package", "mcp", "start", "--tool", "my_tool_1", "--tool", "my_tool_2"]
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
