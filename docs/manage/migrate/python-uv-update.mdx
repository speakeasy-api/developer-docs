# Migrate from Python poetry to uv

The Speakeasy Python SDK generator now uses `uv` as the default packaging and dependency management tool for generated SDKs.

## Changes overview

To improve performance and align with modern Python tooling standards, the Python SDK generation process implements a significant change in dependency management:

The default packaging and dependency management tool changes from `poetry` to `uv` for all newly generated SDKs.

## Why uv?

Designed as a faster, more modern replacement for `poetry`, `uv` provides strong support for Python packaging standards and significantly improved performance for dependency resolution and installation.

## Continued poetry support

Speakeasy continues to support `poetry`, and SDK producers who prefer it can opt in via generator configuration.

## What to expect

- Newly generated SDKs default to `uv` unless overridden.
- Existing workflows using `poetry` will continue to work without changes.
- Future updates will focus on enhancing `uv` support as it becomes the ecosystem standard.
