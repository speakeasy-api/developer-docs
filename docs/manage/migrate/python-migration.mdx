# Upgrade to the Python v2 SDK with the Speakeasy CLI

To upgrade your Python SDK to Python v2 using the Speakeasy CLI, follow these four steps:

## Update the `gen.yaml` file

- Add `templateVersion: v2` to the Python section of your `gen.yaml` file.
- If you have an `additionalDependencies` section under `python`, it needs modification. If you haven't changed it previously, you can delete it and it will be recreated in the correct format. Otherwise, modify it from this:

     ```yaml
     additionalDependencies:
       dependencies: {}
       extraDependencies:
         dev: {}
     ```

     To this:

     ```yaml
     additionalDependencies:
       dev: {}
       main: {}
     ```

  - Move any dependencies listed under the `dependencies` key to `main`.
  - Move any dependencies under `extraDependencies.dev` to `dev`.
  - Move any additional keys under `extraDependencies` to the top-level `additionalDependencies` next to the other keys.

## Update the `author` key

- Change the old `author` key, under `python`, to the new `authors` key, which is an array of authors.

     ```yaml
     python:
       authors:
         - Speakeasy
       # other configurations...
     ```

## Generate the Python v2 SDK

- Run the `speakeasy run` command to generate the Python SDK.

## Adjust the imports for Python v2

One of the main changes in Python v2 is how imported packages are handled. In version 1, `sdkClassName` specified the top-level module. In version 2, `packageName` is now used for imports, and matches the expected naming conventions for packages installed from PyPI. Some code imports may need to be adjusted for this change.

For example, given the `sdkClassName` of `speakeasy` and the `packageName` of `speakeasy-sdk`, the code was previously generated in the `src/speakeasy` directory and imported as follows:

```python
from speakeasy import Speakeasy
```

In version 2, the code is generated in the `src/speakeasy_sdk` directory and imported as follows:

```python
from speakeasy_sdk import Speakeasy
```

- If you have custom hooks, move the custom hook files and the hook registration logic in `registration.py` from the old `sdkClassName`-based code-generation directory to the new `packageName`-based code-generation directory and update the imports accordingly:

     ```python
     # Old import
     from speakeasy.hooks import CustomHook

     # New import
     from speakeasy_sdk.hooks import CustomHook
     ```

- If you do not have custom hooks, delete the old `src/speakeasy` folder:

     ```sh
     rm -rf src/speakeasy
     ```
