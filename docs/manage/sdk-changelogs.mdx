# SDK Changelogs

## Overview

SDK changes should be transparent and easy to validate. Comprehensive SDK release notes serve two critical purposes:

- providing SDK maintainers with detailed summaries on every pull request to validate changes
- providing end users with clear documentation to track SDK evolution over time.

## Prerequisites

- In GitHub Actions, `speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action` v15.49.1 or above
- Speakeasy CLI v1.605.5 or above

## Getting started

The feature works automatically with existing Speakeasy workflows when the above requirements are met. No configuration changes are required. SDK updates include enhanced release notes information in:

- Pull request descriptions
- Commit messages
- Release notes

## PR summaries and commit messages for SDK maintainers

Every SDK generation results in a commit message that includes a comprehensive summary of changes. These commit messages are bundled into a PR summary that allows maintainers to easily validate SDK changes before merging.

The commit message will include a line for each change made to the SDK, including:

- **Added methods**: New functionality being introduced
- **Removed methods**: Deprecated functionality being removed (flagged as breaking)
- **Modified methods**: Changed signatures, parameters, or behavior
- **Breaking change indicators**: Clear warnings for any backward-incompatible changes

The following screenshot shows an example of how commit messages and PR summaries appear in GitHub, with detailed information about method changes and breaking change indicators:

/>

This improvement helps SDK maintainers with code review and maintaining Git history hygiene.

## Detailed release notes for SDK users

SDK users can check changes from two sources:

- Check the SDK commit history to see when certain capabilities were added or modified
- Read release notes for the SDK

Once changes are validated and merged by maintainers, detailed information becomes part of the SDK's public release notes:

- **Method-level change tracking**: See exactly which methods were added, modified, or removed
- **Breaking change visibility**: Clear indicators for any changes that could impact existing integrations
- **Version comparison**: Easy-to-scan summaries that help assess upgrade impact

## Modifying release notes

SDK maintainers can add custom messaging to SDK release notes:

- Open the **PR** that requires release notes changes
- Edit the **ReleaseNotes** section in the `gen.lock` file to add or remove information (as shown in the screenshot below)

    src: "/assets/docs/updating_release_notes.png",
    alt: "updating release notes",
  }}
/>

- **Commit** the change

Once the **PR** is merged and a **GitHub Release** is generated, the entire text in the `ReleaseNotes` field in `gen.lock` will be added to the **Release Notes Body** (as shown in the screenshot below).
