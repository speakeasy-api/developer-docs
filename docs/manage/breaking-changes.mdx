# Handling breaking changes in SDKs

This guide explains how to handle breaking changes in APIs when using Speakeasy-generated SDKs. Follow these guidelines to maintain backward compatibility and ensure a smooth experience for your SDK users.

## Safe changes

The following API changes are safe and won't break existing SDKs:

### Adding new fields

You can safely add new fields to API responses because older SDK versions ignore these fields. Adding new response fields doesn't break existing integrations.

### Adding new enum values

You can safely add new enum values when enums are marked with `x-speakeasy-unknown-values` (see our [Customize enums](/docs/customize/data-model/enums#open-enums) documentation). Older SDKs handle these new values gracefully according to the behavior specified in the extension configuration.

## Changes requiring caution

Some API changes require careful consideration to avoid breaking existing SDK implementations. Use the [OpenAPI diff tool](/docs/speakeasy-reference/cli/openapi/diff) to identify potential breaking changes in your API specification.

### Deprecating required fields

Take care when deprecating fields marked as required in the API specification. Older SDKs may throw validation errors if required fields are missing:

- Make the field optional before removing it.
- Plan a deprecation period for implementation updates.

### Modifying oneOf schemas

Make changes to `oneOf` schemas carefully, as adding new variants may cause type mismatch errors in older SDKs:

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing schema variants.
- Test changes thoroughly with older SDK versions.

## Future improvements

Speakeasy is developing additional features to help you manage breaking changes, including:

- SDK version upgrade prompts
- Improved tooling for breaking changes
- Enhanced version management capabilities
