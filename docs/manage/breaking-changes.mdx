# Handling breaking changes in SDKs

This guide explains how to handle breaking changes in APIs when using
Speakeasy-generated SDKs. Following these guidelines helps maintain backward
compatibility and ensures a smooth experience for SDK users.

## Safe changes

The following API changes are safe and won't break existing SDKs:

### Adding new fields

Adding new fields to API responses is safe because older SDK versions ignore
these fields. New response fields can be added without breaking existing
integrations.

### Adding new enum values

Adding new enum values is safe when enums are marked with
`x-speakeasy-unknown-values` ([see enums customization doc](/docs/customize/data-model/enums#open-enums)). Older SDKs handle
these new values gracefully according to the behavior specified in the
extension configuration.


## Changes requiring caution

Some API changes require careful consideration to avoid breaking existing SDK
implementations. Use the [OpenAPI diff tool](/docs/speakeasy-reference/cli/openapi/diff) to identify potential breaking
changes in your API specification:



### Deprecating required fields

When deprecating fields marked as required in the API specification:
- Older SDKs throw validation errors if the field is missing
- Make the field optional before removing it
- Plan a deprecation period for implementation updates

### Modifying oneOf schemas

Make changes to `oneOf` schemas carefully:
- Adding new variants may cause type mismatch errors in older SDKs
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing schema variants
- Test changes thoroughly with older SDK versions

## Future improvements

Speakeasy is developing additional features to help manage breaking changes:
- SDK version upgrade prompts
- Improved tooling for breaking changes
- Enhanced version management capabilities
