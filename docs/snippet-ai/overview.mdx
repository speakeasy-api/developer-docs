Add SnippetAI to web applications as a web component to help users generate code snippets with AI-powered tools.

## How It Works

SnippetAI offers an intuitive interface for code snippet generation. Users type questions about API usage, and the component responds with ready-to-use code examples that leverage the actual SDK and code samples. SnippetAI stands out by using the existing SDK, which helps users discover the API's capabilities.

For example, when a user submits the query:
"How do I create a new user with the API?"

The component analyzes the OpenAPI specification and SDK code samples to generate a function that answers their question, matching the actual implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing SnippetAI, complete the following configuration steps:

1. Enable the SnippetAI add-on in documentation settings:
   - Navigate to the Docs tab in the Speakeasy dashboard
   - Select the SnippetAI card

  }}
/>

2. Activate SnippetAI using the toggle switch. The indicator will display green when SnippetAI is enabled

  }}
/>

3. Generate and configure a publishing token:
   - Select "New" to access the token configuration interface
   - Provide a descriptive identifier for the token
   - Select the target SDK
   - Define the SDK tag
   - Select "Generate" to create the token

  }}
/>

4. Integrate Snippet AI into the docsite
  - Upon completion, the site displays an integration guide with the publishing token and a quick start guide
  - Further details below!

## Integration Options

### React

Implement SnippetAI as a React component to integrate with React-based documentation.

### Web Component

Implement SnippetAI as a web component by selecting one of two script integration methods:

- **ES Module**: Recommended for modern web applications, providing optimal tree-shaking and module support
- **UMD**: Suitable for legacy browsers and traditional script loading implementations

Include the selected script tag in the HTML file's `<head>` section before implementing the `<snippet-ai>` element.

## Usage

Once integrated into documentation, users can invoke the SnippetAI interface via the `Generate Code Example` button or the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜+S` / `Ctrl+S` to:
- Ask natural language questions about how to use the API
- Receive contextually relevant code snippets that use the actual SDKs
- Copy generated code directly into their applications to rapidly decrease time-to-integration
