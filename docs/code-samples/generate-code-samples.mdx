# Generating code samples for your SDK

This guide explains how code samples are generated for an SDK and how to apply them to an OpenAPI document.

## What is the code samples extension?

Many API documentation providers provide code snippets in multiple languages to help developers understand how to use the API. However, these snippets
may not correspond to a usage snippet from an existing SDK provided by the API, which reduces the value of the API documentation and can lead to inconsistent integrations, depending on whether a user discovers the API docs or the SDK first.

The `x-codeSamples` extension (previously called `x-code-samples`) is a widely accepted OpenAPI Specification extension that enables the addition of custom code samples in multiple languages to operation IDs in an OpenAPI document.
When custom code samples are added using the code samples extension, documentation providers will render the usage snippet in the right-hand panel of the documentation page:

For a full breakdown of the code samples extension, see our [guide](/guides/openapi/x-codesamples).

## Configuring code samples

Speakeasy provides code samples in the form of [overlays](/docs/prep-openapi/overlays/create-overlays#what-are-overlays). This ensures that your code samples can be trivially applied to your OpenAPI document without needing to upstream the changes.

The setup for using overlays to apply code samples is configured in your workflow file, as follows:

```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
# ...
targets:
  my-target:
    target: typescript
    source: my-source
    codeSamples:
      output: code-samples.yaml # Optional, if you would like a local copy of your code samples to be produced
      registry:
        location: registry.speakeasy.com/my-org/my-workspace/my-source-typescript-code-samples
      blocking: false # Optional, defaults to true if not present
```

In the above example, a code samples overlay containing TypeScript usage snippets for all operations in the `my-source` OpenAPI document will be
generated and written to `code-samples.yaml` and pushed to the Speakeasy registry.

<Callout title="Why use the registry?" variant="success">
  Speakeasy will automatically load code samples that are pushed to the registry and apply them to your OpenAPI document.
  This saves you from having to manually configure a workflow to integrate your code samples into your base document.
  Removing the `registry` section from your workflow file will disable this feature and require you to manually apply code samples to your OpenAPI document.
</Callout>

### Overrides

To override the `lang` and `label` values, you can add either or both of the following options to the `codeSamples` section in your `workflow.yaml` file:

```yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    codeSamples:
      # ...
      langOverride: <any string> # set `lang` to this value in all code samples
      labelOverride:
        omit: true # omit the label field entirely from the output
        # OR
        fixedValue: <any string> # set the label to this value in all code samples
```

### Styles

For certain documentation providers like ReadMe, you will need to override the default style of code samples in your OpenAPI document.
To override the default style, modify the following option in the `codeSamples` section of your `workflow.yaml` file:

```yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    codeSamples:
      # ...
      style: readme # Default is 'standard'
```

## Automatic code sample URLs

For paid accounts, Speakeasy provides an elegant solution for exposing code samples to documentation providers through its automated code sample URLs product.

For a full breakdown of the feature, see the [guide](/docs/automated-code-sample-urls).

## Manually applying code samples to an OpenAPI document

Alternatively, you can manually set up code sample integrations by pulling together code sample images in your repository with a simple workflow.

```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  docs-source:
    inputs:
      - location: { { your_api_spec } } # local or remote references supported
    overlays:
      - location: registry.speakeasyapi.dev/<org>/<workspace>/my-typescript-sdk-code-samples # location of the code samples from previous step
      - location: registry.speakeasyapi.dev/<org>/<workspace>/my-go-sdk-code-samples
      - location: registry.speakeasyapi.dev/<org>/<workspace>/my-python-sdk-code-samples
    output: openapi.yaml
targets: {}
```

```yaml .github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml
name: Generate
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
jobs:
  generate:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/workflow-executor.yaml@v15
    with:
      force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
      mode: pr
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

Now you can run `speakeasy run`. If you use registry references, the source and code samples will always be up to date with the main branch of your SDK repos.
