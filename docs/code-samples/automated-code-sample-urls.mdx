# Automated code sample URLs

For paid accounts, Speakeasy can automatically apply code samples to your base OpenAPI document in the cloud, with no intervention required.
This is the most elegant solution for exposing code samples to documentation providers.

In the **APIs** tab of the dashboard, look for an entry marked as **Combined Spec**.
Click into the entry to see a breakdown of the base OpenAPI document and code samples overlays that were used to produce it.

  image={{
    src: combinedSpecImage,
    alt: "Screenshot of the dashboard showing a Combined Spec."
  }}
/>

<Screenshot 
  variant="web"
  image={{
    src: combinedSpecDetailsImage,
    alt: "Screenshot of the dashboard showing Combined Spec details."
  }}
/>

To configure one of these combined code sample specs as a public URL for documentation providers, visit the **Docs** tab in the Speakeasy dashboard.

## How Speakeasy automates code sample URLs

Speakeasy automatically tracks your base OpenAPI document and code samples when you generate an SDK using GitHub Actions and merge the changes to the main branch.
Based on this, Speakeasy generates a combined spec in the background that contains all your existing OpenAPI operations along with any added `x-code-samples` extensions.

## Requirements for using automated code sample URLs

If you have not yet completed your SDK setup in GitHub, you may see a notification like the following in the **Docs** tab.

<Screenshot 
  variant="web"
  image={{
    src: automaticCodeSamplesImage,
    alt: "Automatic code sample URLs not available."
  }}
/>

To use automated code sample URLs, your SDK must meet the following requirements:

- Each SDK's `workflow.yaml` file must include the following:
  - The `source` (your OpenAPI document) with a specified `registry` location.
  - The `target` (your SDK) with a `codeSamples` section that includes a specified `registry` location.
- The SDK must be generated with GitHub Actions and merged to main.
- The SDK GitHub Action must be in `direct` mode, or the `sdk-publish` action must be configured. While publishing to a package manager is _not_ necessary, release tagging must be handled by this action.
- The base OpenAPI document must not include `x-codeSamples` extensions, as they will not be overwritten.

When your setup is correct, the following will be available in the **APIs** tab of the Speakeasy dashboard:

- An entry for your base OpenAPI document (for example, `my-source`).
- For each SDK you include, a corresponding code samples overlay (for example, `my-source-{lang}-code-samples`).

Revisions to the base OpenAPI document and code sample overlays must be tagged with `main`, which is why using GitHub Actions is required.

<Callout title="Alternatives to configuring sdk-publish.yaml:" type="warning">
If you are not ready to set up publishing, you can temporarily set up the following tagging action in each of your SDK repos.

```yaml .github/workflows/tagging.yaml
name: Speakeasy Tagging
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
"on":
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths: []
  workflow_dispatch: {}
jobs:
  tag:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/tag.yaml@v15
    with:
      registry_tags: main
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

</Callout>
