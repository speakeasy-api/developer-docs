# The gen.yaml file reference

<Callout title="TIP" variant="info">

For most use cases, the `speakeasy configure` command is the recommended means of interacting with the Speakeasy `gen.yaml` file. The `speakeasy configure` command has subcommands for configuring sources, targets, GitHub workflow setups, and package publications. All new targets created using `speakeasy quickstart` automatically generate workflow files in the `.speakeasy/` folder in the root of the target directory.

The <Image src={vsCodeImageUrl} alt="VS Code" width="20" height="20" style={{display: "inline-block"}} /> [Speakeasy VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Speakeasy.speakeasy-vscode-extension) provides several useful features for manually editing the `gen.yaml` file, including syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and linting for OpenAPI documents and other supported file types.

</Callout>

The `gen.yaml` file has several sections:

- The `generation` section is essential for SDK configuration
- The `management` and `features` sections are maintained by Speakeasy and should not be edited
- The final section is for language-specific configuration (for more information, see the language-specific configuration docs)

## Generation

<ScrollyCoding>

#### !!steps `configVersion`

The currently supported version of the Speakeasy `gen.yaml` configuration file is `2.0.0`. Older versions will be automatically upgraded when encountered.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(1)
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  sdkClassName: speakeasybar
  maintainOpenAPIOrder: true
  usageSnippets:
    optionalPropertyRendering: withExample
  devContainers:
    enabled: true
    schemaPath: "path/to/schema"
  useClassNamesForArrayFields: true
  fixes:
    nameResolutionDec2023: true
    parameterOrderingFeb2024: true
    requestResponseComponentNamesFeb2024: true
  auth:
    OAuth2ClientCredentialsEnabled: true
  baseServerUrl: "speakeasy.bar/public/api/"
  mockServer:
    disabled: true
# Add language-specific configs here
```

---

#### !!steps `generation`

The `generation` section of the `gen.yaml` file supports configuration that is relevant to all SDK targets. If a value isn't configured here, and it has a default value, then that value will be added automatically on the next generation. For more information about SDK generation and targets, see our [core concepts documentation](/docs/core-concepts#sdk-generation).

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(2:17)
```

---

#### !!steps `sdkClassName`

Defines the class name of the main imported class in the generated SDK.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(3)
```

---

#### !!steps `maintainOpenAPIOrder`

Determines whether the parameters, properties, operations, etc., are maintained in the same order they appear in the OpenAPI document. If set to `false`, these elements are sorted alphabetically.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(4)
```

---

#### !!steps `usageSnippets`

The options for `optionalPropertyRendering` include `always`, `never`, and `withExample`, which renders optional properties only when an example is present in the OpenAPI document.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(5:6)
```

---

#### !!steps `devContainers`

Enables or disables the use of development containers, and specifies the schema path. For more information about development containers and SDK sandboxes, see our [SDK sandbox documentation](/docs/manage/sdk-sandbox).

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(7:9)
```

---

#### !!steps `useClassNamesForArrayFields`

When set to true, array fields use class names instead of child schema types.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(10)
```

---

#### !!steps `fixes`

Includes specific fixes or features to be applied during SDK generation to avoid breaking changes.

- `nameResolutionDec2023`: **Disabling not recommended**. Enables changes introduced in December 2023 for improved name resolution, defaults to `true` for new SDKs. For older SDKs, setting `true` is recommended, but will be a breaking change.  
- `parameterOrderingFeb2024`: **Disabling not recommended**. Enables changes introduced in February 2024 to respect the order of parameters in the OpenAPI document where possible, defaults to `true` for new SDKs. For older SDKs, setting `true` is recommended, but will be a breaking change.  
- `requestResponseComponentNamesFeb2024`: **Disabling not recommended**. Enables changes introduced in February 2024 to use the name of parent request/response components where possible, defaults to `true` for new SDKs. For older SDKs, setting `true` is recommended, but will be a breaking change.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(11:14)
```

---

#### !!steps `auth`

- `OAuth2ClientCredentialsEnabled`: Enables the generation of code for handling OAuth 2.0 client credentials for authentication, where possible. **Enterprise license only**.

For detailed information about authentication configuration, see our [guide to customizing security and authentication](/docs/customize/authentication/configuration).

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(15:16)
```

---

#### !!steps `baseServerUrl`

Used to declare your base server URL. It overrides the `servers` field in your OpenAPI document if present, or provides a server URL if the `servers` field is absent.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(17)
```

---

#### !!steps `mockServer`

Disables the generation and use of a mock HTTP server with generated tests.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(18)
```
