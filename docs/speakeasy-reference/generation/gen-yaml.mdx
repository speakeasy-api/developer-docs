# The gen.yaml file reference

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">

For most use cases, the `speakeasy configure` command is the recommended means of interacting with the Speakeasy `gen.yaml` file. The `speakeasy configure` command has subcommands for configuring sources, targets, GitHub workflow setups, and package publications. All new targets created using `speakeasy quickstart` automatically generate workflow files in the `.speakeasy/` folder in the root of the target directory.
<br/>
The <Image src="/assets/vscode.svg" alt="VS Code" width="20" height="20" style={{display: "inline-block", verticalAlign: "middle"}} /> [Speakeasy VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Speakeasy.speakeasy-vscode-extension) provides several useful features for manually editing the `gen.yaml` file, including syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and linting for OpenAPI documents and other supported file types.

</Callout>

The `gen.yaml` file has several sections:

- The `generation` section is essential for SDK configuration
- The `management` and `features` sections are maintained by Speakeasy and should not be edited
- The final section is for language-specific configuration (for more information, see the language-specific configuration docs)

## Generation

### configVersion

The currently supported version of the Speakeasy `gen.yaml` configuration file is `2.0.0`. Older versions will be automatically upgraded when encountered.

```yaml
configVersion: 2.0.0
```

### generation

The `generation` section of the `gen.yaml` file supports configuration that is relevant to all SDK targets. If a value isn&apos;t configured here, and it has a default value, then that value will be added automatically on the next generation. For more information about SDK generation and targets, see our [core concepts documentation](/docs/core-concepts#sdk-generation).

```yaml
generation:
  sdkClassName: speakeasybar
  maintainOpenAPIOrder: true
  usageSnippets:
    optionalPropertyRendering: withExample
  devContainers:
    enabled: true
    schemaPath: "path/to/schema"
  useClassNamesForArrayFields: true
  fixes:
    nameResolutionDec2023: true
    parameterOrderingFeb2024: true
    requestResponseComponentNamesFeb2024: true
    securityFeb2025: true
  auth:
    OAuth2ClientCredentialsEnabled: true
```

### sdkClassName

Defines the class name of the main imported class in the generated SDK.

```yaml
  sdkClassName: speakeasybar
```

### maintainOpenAPIOrder

Determines whether the parameters, properties, operations, etc., are maintained in the same order they appear in the OpenAPI document. If set to `false`, these elements are sorted alphabetically.

```yaml
  maintainOpenAPIOrder: true
```

### usageSnippets

The options for `optionalPropertyRendering` include `always`, `never`, and `withExample`, which renders optional properties only when an example is present in the OpenAPI document.

```yaml
  usageSnippets:
    optionalPropertyRendering: withExample
```

### devContainers

Enables or disables the use of development containers, and specifies the schema path. For more information about development containers and SDK sandboxes, see our [SDK sandbox documentation](/docs/manage/sdk-sandbox).

```yaml
  devContainers:
    enabled: true
    schemaPath: "path/to/schema"
```

### useClassNamesForArrayFields

When set to true, array fields use class names instead of child schema types.

```yaml
  useClassNamesForArrayFields: true
```

### fixes

Includes specific fixes or features to be applied during SDK generation to avoid breaking changes.

- `nameResolutionDec2023`: **Disabling not recommended**. Enables changes introduced in December 2023 for improved name resolution, defaults to `true` for new SDKs. For older SDKs, setting `true` is recommended, but will be a breaking change.
- `parameterOrderingFeb2024`: **Disabling not recommended**. Enables changes introduced in February 2024 to respect the order of parameters in the OpenAPI document where possible, defaults to `true` for new SDKs. For older SDKs, setting `true` is recommended, but will be a breaking change.
- `requestResponseComponentNamesFeb2024`: **Disabling not recommended**. Enables changes introduced in February 2024 to use the name of parent request/response components where possible, defaults to `true` for new SDKs. For older SDKs, setting `true` is recommended, but will be a breaking change.
- `securityFeb2025`: **Disabling not recommended**. Enables changes introduced in February 2025 to the security handling at both the global and operation level, particularly needed to enable per-operation OAuth2 flows. Defaults to `true` for new SDKs. For older SDKs, setting `true` is recommended, but will be a breaking change.

```yaml
  fixes:
    nameResolutionDec2023: true
    parameterOrderingFeb2024: true
    requestResponseComponentNamesFeb2024: true
    securityFeb2025: true
```

### auth

- `OAuth2ClientCredentialsEnabled`: Enables the generation of code for handling OAuth 2.0 client credentials for authentication, where possible. **Business and Enterprise plans only**.
- `hoistGlobalSecurity`: When `true` (default), Speakeasy identifies the most commonly used operation-level security scheme and hoists it to global security if no global security is defined. Set to `false` to disable this behavior.

For detailed information about authentication configuration, see our [guide to customizing security and authentication](/docs/customize/authentication/configuration).

```yaml
  auth:
    OAuth2ClientCredentialsEnabled: true
    hoistGlobalSecurity: true
```

#### Disable security hoisting

Set `hoistGlobalSecurity` to `false` to opt out:

```yaml
auth:
  hoistGlobalSecurity: false
```

### baseServerUrl

Used to declare the base server URL. It overrides the `servers` field in the OpenAPI document if present, or provides a server URL if the `servers` field is absent.

```yaml
  baseServerUrl: "speakeasy.bar/public/api/"
```

### mockServer

Disables the generation and use of a mock HTTP server with generated tests.

```yaml
  mockServer:
    disabled: true
```
