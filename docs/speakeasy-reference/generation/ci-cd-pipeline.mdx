# Workflow matrix

<Callout title="Tip">
  To quickly set up the workflow, run `speakeasy configure github` in the root
  of the SDK repository. This automates the setup and commits the necessary
  files. For more complex or custom configurations, the following is supported.
</Callout>

## Workflow inputs

```yml
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
      set_version:
        description: optionally set a specific SDK version
        type: string
      runs-on:
        description: Runner to use for the workflow (e.g., large-ubuntu-runner)
        type: string
        default: ubuntu-latest
```

The inputs to the workflow determine how the SDKs will be generated.

<Table
  data={[
    {
      name: "speakeasy_version",
      description:
        'Version of the Speakeasy CLI to use. Use "latest" to always use the latest version.',
      type: "string",
      default: "latest",
    },

  ]}
/>

## Workflow jobs

The generate job utilizes the Speakeasy SDK generation action. It references the `workflow-executor.yaml` from the `sdk-generation-action` repo, which handles the core operations like pulling the OpenAPI document, validating it, and generating the SDKs.

### With

```yml

## Workflow outputs

The workflow provides outputs that indicate which SDKs were regenerated and can trigger further actions in the pipeline, such as validating, testing, and publishing the SDKs.
