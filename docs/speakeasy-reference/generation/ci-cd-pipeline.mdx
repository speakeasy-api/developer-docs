# Workflow matrix


<Callout title="TIP" variant="success"> To quickly set up the workflow, run `speakeasy configure github` in the root of the SDK repository. This automates the setup and commits the necessary files. For more complex or custom configurations, the following is supported. </Callout>

## Workflow inputs

```yml
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
      set_version:
        description: optionally set a specific SDK version
        type: string
```

The inputs to the workflow determine how the SDKs will be generated.

| **Input Name**  | **Description**                                                                    | **Type** | **Default** |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `force`         | Forces SDK generation even if no changes are detected in the OpenAPI document.      | boolean  | `false`     |
| `set_version`   | Optionally set a specific version for the SDKs.                                     | string   | N/A         |

## Workflow jobs

The generate job utilizes the Speakeasy SDK generation action. It references the `workflow-executor.yaml` from the `sdk-generation-action` repo, which handles the core operations like pulling the OpenAPI document, validating it, and generating the SDKs.

### With

```yml
jobs:
  generate:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/workflow-executor.yaml@v15
    with:
      force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
      mode: pr
      set_version: ${{ github.event.inputs.set_version }}
      speakeasy_version: latest
```

| **Input Name**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           | **Type** | **Default** |

| `speakeasy_version` | Version of the Speakeasy CLI to use. Use "latest" to always use the latest version.                                                                                        | string   | `latest`    |
| `mode`              | Workflow mode: `direct` commits changes directly to the branch, `pr` creates a pull request, or `test` fully runs through generation without modifying any GitHub state.    | string   | `direct`    |
| `force`             | Forces SDK generation, even if no changes are detected.                                                                                                                    | boolean  | `false`     |
| `set_version`       | Manually set a specific version for the SDK being generated.                                                                                                               | string   | None        |
