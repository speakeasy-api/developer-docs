# Using Speakeasy with Docker

The Speakeasy Docker image provides a containerized environment for running Speakeasy CLI commands. The image includes all necessary build tools for all languages supported by Speakeasy, making it ideal for CI/CD pipelines and consistent development environments.

## Docker image

The official Speakeasy Docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry:

[ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/pkgs/container/speakeasy)

## Installation

Pull the latest Speakeasy Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest
```

You can also use specific version tags instead of `latest` for reproducible builds:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:v1.234.0
```

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Speakeasy Platform from within a Docker container, you need to:

1. Set the `SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT` environment variable
2. Expose the callback port for OAuth authentication
3. Mount your workspace directory

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    -e SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT=$SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT \
    -p $SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT:$SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest auth login
```

After running this command, a browser window will open for you to authenticate with the Speakeasy Platform.

### Using API keys in CI/CD

For automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, use an API key instead of interactive authentication:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    -e SPEAKEASY_API_KEY=$SPEAKEASY_API_KEY \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest run
```

Create an API key in the [Speakeasy Platform](https://app.speakeasy.com) and set it as the `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Generate SDK

To generate an SDK using the Docker image, mount your workspace directory and run the generation command:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest run all --pinned --frozen-workflow-lockfile --output console
```

This command:
- Mounts the current directory to `/workspace` in the container
- Sets the working directory to `/workspace`
- Runs all configured SDK generation workflows
- Uses pinned versions for reproducibility
- Uses a frozen workflow lockfile to ensure consistent dependencies
- Outputs results to the console

## Common usage examples

### Run quickstart

Get started with an interactive quickstart:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest quickstart
```

### Validate OpenAPI spec

Validate your OpenAPI specification:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest validate openapi -s ./openapi.yaml
```

### Generate SDK for specific language

Generate an SDK for a specific language:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest run -t typescript
```

### Check SDK status

Check the status of your SDK generation:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest status
```

## Included build tools

The Speakeasy Docker image includes all necessary build tools for generating SDKs in the following languages:

- TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js, npm, pnpm, yarn)
- Python (Python 3.x, pip, poetry)
- Go (Go compiler and tools)
- Java (JDK, Maven, Gradle)
- C# (.NET SDK)
- PHP (PHP runtime and Composer)
- Ruby (Ruby runtime and Bundler)
- Rust (Rust compiler and Cargo)

This ensures that SDK generation works out of the box without requiring additional setup or dependencies.

## Using in CI/CD pipelines

The Docker image is designed for use in CI/CD pipelines. Here's an example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Generate SDK
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Generate SDK
        run: |
          docker run -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
            -e SPEAKEASY_API_KEY=${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }} \
            ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest run all --pinned --frozen-workflow-lockfile
```

## Volume mounts and permissions

When using the Docker image, ensure that:

1. Your workspace directory is mounted to `/workspace`
2. The working directory is set to `/workspace` with `-w "/workspace"`
3. File permissions allow the container to read and write files

If you encounter permission issues, you may need to adjust file ownership or run the container with appropriate user permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication issues

If authentication fails, ensure that:
- The callback port is properly exposed with `-p`
- The `SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT` environment variable is set
- Your firewall allows connections on the callback port

### File permission errors

If you encounter file permission errors, try running the container with your user ID:

```bash
docker run -it --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest run
```

### Network connectivity

Ensure your Docker container has network access to:
- The Speakeasy Platform (app.speakeasy.com)
- Package registries for your target languages
- Your OpenAPI specification source (if remote)
