# Using Speakeasy with Docker

The Speakeasy Docker image provides a containerized environment for running Speakeasy CLI commands. The image does not include language toolchains, so it cannot be used for SDK generation. Use it for other tasks like validating OpenAPI specs, checking SDK status, and running quickstart commands.

## Docker image

The official Speakeasy Docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry:

[ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/pkgs/container/speakeasy)

## Installation

Pull the latest Speakeasy Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest
```

You can also use specific version tags instead of `latest` for reproducible builds:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:v1.234.0
```

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Speakeasy Platform from within a Docker container, you need to:

1. Set the `SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT` environment variable
2. Expose the callback port for OAuth authentication
3. Mount your workspace directory

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    -e SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT=$SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT \
    -p $SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT:$SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest auth login
```

After running this command, a browser window will open for you to authenticate with the Speakeasy Platform.

### Using API keys in CI/CD

For automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, use an API key instead of interactive authentication:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    -e SPEAKEASY_API_KEY=$SPEAKEASY_API_KEY \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest run
```

Create an API key in the [Speakeasy Platform](https://app.speakeasy.com) and set it as the `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Common usage examples

### Run quickstart

Get started with an interactive quickstart:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest quickstart
```

### Validate OpenAPI spec

Validate your OpenAPI specification:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest validate openapi -s ./openapi.yaml
```

### Check SDK status

Check the status of your SDK generation:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest status
```

## Using in CI/CD pipelines

The Docker image is designed for use in CI/CD pipelines. Here's an example GitHub Actions workflow for validating an OpenAPI spec:

```yaml
name: Validate OpenAPI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Validate OpenAPI spec
        run: |
          docker run -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
            ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest validate openapi -s ./openapi.yaml
```

## Volume mounts and permissions

When using the Docker image, ensure that:

1. Your workspace directory is mounted to `/workspace`
2. The working directory is set to `/workspace` with `-w "/workspace"`
3. File permissions allow the container to read and write files

If you encounter permission issues, you may need to adjust file ownership or run the container with appropriate user permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication issues

If authentication fails, ensure that:
- The callback port is properly exposed with `-p`
- The `SPEAKEASY_LOGIN_CALLBACK_PORT` environment variable is set
- Your firewall allows connections on the callback port

### File permission errors

If file permission errors occur, try running the container with the appropriate user ID:

```bash
docker run -it --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/speakeasy-api/speakeasy:latest validate openapi -s ./openapi.yaml
```

### Network connectivity

Ensure the Docker container has network access to:
- The Speakeasy Platform (app.speakeasy.com)
- The OpenAPI specification source (if remote)
