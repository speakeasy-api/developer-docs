# Getting Started

The Speakeasy CLI provides access to features of the Speakeasy Platform. This CLI supports an interactive mode. Simply type `speakeasy` in the terminal for a guided set-up and usage experience.

## Install

In the terminal, run:

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install speakeasy-api/tap/speakeasy
```

### Script (macOS and Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh
```

### winget (Windows)

```cmd
winget install speakeasy
```

### Chocolatey (Windows)

```cmd
choco install speakeasy
```

### Manual Installation

Download the latest Speakeasy CLI release for the appropriate platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/releases), extract, and add the binary to the path.

## Authenticate

Authenticate with the Speakeasy Platform to use the Speakeasy CLI:

```bash
speakeasy auth login
```

A browser window will open. Log in to the Speakeasy Platform and create a workspace (or select a workspace if you have previously used the platform) by following the prompts.

When redirected to the workspace, Speakeasy will generate an API key. Return to the terminal to see a message confirming authentication.

## Run

Get started with the installed Speakeasy CLI with a single interactive command.

```bash
speakeasy quickstart
```

Getting started is that easy.

For the full set of CLI commands, type `speakeasy -h`.

## Using the Speakeasy CLI in CI/CD

To use the Speakeasy CLI in a CI/CD pipeline, authenticate it by creating an API key in the [Speakeasy Platform](https://app.speakeasy.com) and then set the `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` environment variable to the value of an API key from the API keys page.
