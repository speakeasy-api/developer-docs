# Getting Started

The Speakeasy CLI provides access to features of the Speakeasy Platform. This CLI supports an interactive mode. Simply type `speakeasy` in your terminal for a guided set-up and usage experience.

## Install

In your terminal, run:

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install speakeasy-api/homebrew-tap/speakeasy
```

### Script (macOS and Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh
```

### winget (Windows)

```cmd
winget install speakeasy
```

### Chocolatey (Windows)

```cmd
choco install speakeasy
```

### Manual Installation

Download the latest Speakeasy CLI release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/releases), extract, and add the binary to your path.

## Authenticate

Authenticate with the Speakeasy Platform to use the Speakeasy CLI:

```bash
speakeasy auth login
```

A browser window will open. Log in to the Speakeasy Platform and create a workspace (or select a workspace if you have previously used the platform) by following the prompts.

When you are redirected to your workspace, Speakeasy will generate an API key for you. Return to the terminal, and you should see a message that you are authenticated.

## Run

Get started with the installed Speakeasy CLI with a single interactive command.

```bash
speakeasy quickstart
```

Getting started is that easy.

For the full set of CLI commands, type `speakeasy -h`.

## Using the Speakeasy CLI in CI/CD

To use the Speakeasy CLI in a CI/CD pipeline, authenticate it by creating an API key in the [Speakeasy Platform](https://app.speakeasy.com) and then set the `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` environment variable to the value of an API key from the API keys page.
