You can use `x-speakeasy-extension-rewrite` to map any extension from the wider OpenAPI ecosystem or another vendor to the equivalent Speakeasy extension. This allows you to use your existing OpenAPI spec without needing to make changes to it, if necessary.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: My API
  version: 1.0.0
x-speakeasy-extension-rewrite:
  x-speakeasy-enums: x-enum-varnames # Maps x-enum-varnames used by the OSS generator to x-speakeasy-enums which has the same functionality
```
