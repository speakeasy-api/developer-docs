# Speakeasy Workflow File

<Callout title="TIP" variant="info">
For most use cases we recommend interacting with the Speakeasy workflow file (`workflow.yaml`) through the `speakeasy configure` command.
This command has subcommands to configure your sources, targets, github setup and package publishing. All new targets created through `speakeasy quickstart` will automatically have a workflow
file created in the `.speakeasy/` folder in the root of their target directory.

For editing the workflow file manually, <Image src={vsCodeImageUrl} alt="VS Code" width="20" height="20" style={{display: "inline-block"}} /> [Speakeasy's VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Speakeasy.speakeasy-vscode-extension) provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for the workflow file,
in addition to linting for OpenAPI documents, and our other supported file types.

</Callout>

The workflow file is a file that dictates how the Speakeasy CLI will interact with sources and targets. The interaction is modelled as a workflow between sources and targets.
A Source is one or more OpenAPI documents and Overlays merged together to create a single OpenAPI documents.
A Target is a SDK, Terraform or other generated artifact from sources.

# File Structure

## Speakeasy Version

The version of the Speakeasy CLI to use to run the workflow. The version can be a specific version or `latest` to use the latest version.
Pinning to a specific version can be useful to ensure that the workflow runs consistently across different environments.

```yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: v1.250.0
```

## Sources

Sources can be added to a workflow programmatically `speakeasy configure sources` or manually by editing the workflow file.

<ScrollyCoding>

### !!steps `sources`

Sources are the inputs to the workflow. A single Source is one or more OpenAPI documents and Overlays that are merged together to create a single OpenAPI document.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(3:13)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  python-sdk:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `my-source`

Each Source is given a name. In this example the name is `my-source`. This name is used to reference the source in the workflow file.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(4)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  python-sdk:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `inputs`

Each Source has a list of inputs. Each input is an OpenAPI document or Overlay. The OpenAPI documents and Overlays are merged together to create a single OpenAPI document.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(5:8)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  python-sdk:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `location`

Each input has a location. The location is the path to the OpenAPI document or Overlay. The path can be a local reference or a remote URL. If a URL is a used
authentication may need to be provided.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(6:8)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  python-sdk:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `transformations`

Sources can include transformations that modify the OpenAPI document before it's used to generate SDKs. Transformations are applied in order after merging inputs and applying overlays.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(7:15)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
    transformations:
      # Remove unused components from the OpenAPI document
      - removeUnused: true
      # Filter to include only specific operations
      - filterOperations:
          operations: getPets, createPet
          include: true
      # General cleanup of the OpenAPI document (formatting and style)
      - cleanup: true
```
---

### !!steps `output`

Each source can specify an output location where the merged OpenAPI document will be written.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(7)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
    output: ./merged-openapi.yaml
```

---

### !!steps `registry`

Sources can be configured to publish to the API Registry found in your Speakeasy workspace.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(7:8)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
    registry:
      location: registry.speakeasyapi.dev/my-org/my-api
```

## Targets

Targets can be added to a workflow programmatically `speakeasy configure targets` or manually by editing the workflow file.

<ScrollyCoding>

### !!steps `targets`

Targets are the outputs of the workflow. A single Target is a SDK, Terraform or other generated artifact from sources.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(16:20)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `my-target`

Each Target is given a name. In this example the name is `my-target`. This name is used to reference the target in the workflow file.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(17)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `target`

Each Target has a type. The target is the type of artifact that will be generated from the sources. The target can be one of the supported languages [here](/docs/create-client-sdks)

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(18)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `source`

Each Target has a source. The source is the name of the source that the target will be generated from.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(19)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `testing`

Each Target supports enabling testing as part of the workflow, if test generation is licensed. This will run target-specific testing, such as `go test` or `pytest`, after code generation. Use this with CLI-only `speakeasy run` development workflows (instead of separately calling `speakeasy test`) or GitHub Actions `mode: direct` or `mode: test` development workflows to ensure tests are successful with any potential code updates.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(20:21)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
    testing:
      enabled: true
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `mockServer`

Target testing, when licensed and enabled, starts a mock API server automatically as part of the workflow. This disables the mock API server, if the testing should always pointed at a test environment server URL instead.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(22:23)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure sources` command
  # ....
  # ....
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
    testing:
      enabled: true
      mockServer:
        enabled: false
  # more inputs can be added here through `speakeasy configure targets` command
  # ....
  # ....
```

---

### !!steps `codeSamples`

Each target can be configured to generate code samples and publish them to Speakeasy's registry.

```yaml ! gen.yaml
# !focus(11:14)
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
    codeSamples:
      output: codeSamples.yaml
      registry:
        location: registry.speakeasyapi.dev/my-org/my-api/code-samples
```
