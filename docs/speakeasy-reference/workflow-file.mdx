# Speakeasy Workflow File

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
For most use cases we recommend interacting with the Speakeasy workflow file (`workflow.yaml`) through the `speakeasy configure` command.
This command has subcommands to configure sources, targets, github setup and package publishing. All new targets created through `speakeasy quickstart` will automatically have a workflow
file created in the `.speakeasy/` folder in the root of their target directory.
<br/>
For editing the workflow file manually, <Image src="/assets/vscode.svg" alt="VS Code" width="20" height="20" className="inline-block! w-auto! size-5 mx-2! my-0" /> [Speakeasy's VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Speakeasy.speakeasy-vscode-extension) provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for the workflow file,
in addition to linting for OpenAPI documents, and our other supported file types.

</Callout>

The workflow file is a file that dictates how the Speakeasy CLI will interact with sources and targets. The interaction is modelled as a workflow between sources and targets.
A Source is one or more OpenAPI documents and Overlays merged together to create a single OpenAPI documents.
A Target is a SDK, Terraform or other generated artifact from sources.

# File Structure

## Speakeasy Version

The version of the Speakeasy CLI to use to run the workflow. The `speakeasyVersion` field accepts three types of values:

- **`latest`**: The Speakeasy CLI will perform a blue/green attempted upgrade to the latest version of the CLI. If there is a failure in generation, it will always re-run on the last successful version. This is the default and always tries to bring in generator upgrades (for example, to dependencies) where those changes compile, lint successfully, and pass tests successfully.

- **`pinned`**: The Speakeasy CLI will always execute on the installed version and won't attempt to change versions. This can be useful for teams with alternative automation to control the Speakeasy CLI version (for example, using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)).

- **A specific version** (for example, `1.493.1`): The Speakeasy CLI will always run on this exact version. This can be useful for teams with stringent change management procedures. Available versions correspond to [Speakeasy CLI releases](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/releases).

```yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: latest
```

```yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: pinned
```

```yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
speakeasyVersion: 1.493.1
```

## Sources

Sources can be added to a workflow programmatically `speakeasy configure sources` or manually by editing the workflow file.

### Sources

Sources are the inputs to the workflow. A single Source is one or more OpenAPI documents and Overlays that are merged together to create a single OpenAPI document.

```yaml
sources:
  my-source:
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
    overlays:
      - location: ./overlay.yaml
      - location: ./another-overlay.yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
    transformations:
```

### SourceName

Each Source is given a name. In this example the name is `my-source`. This name is used to reference the source in the workflow file.

```yaml
  my-source:
```

### Inputs

Each Source has a list of inputs. Each input is an OpenAPI document or Overlay. The OpenAPI documents and Overlays are merged together to create a single OpenAPI document.

```yaml
    inputs:
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
```

### Location

Each input has a location. The location is the path to the OpenAPI document or Overlay. The path can be a local reference or a remote URL. If a URL is a used
authentication may need to be provided.

```yaml
      - location: ./openapi.yaml
      - location: ./another-openapi.yaml
      # .... more openapi documents can be added here
```

### Transformations

Sources can include transformations that modify the OpenAPI document before it's used to generate SDKs. Transformations are applied in order after merging inputs and applying overlays.

```yaml
      # .... more openapi overlays can be added here
    transformations:
      # Remove unused components from the OpenAPI document
      - removeUnused: true
      # Filter to include only specific operations
      - filterOperations:
          operations: getPets, createPet
          include: true
      # General cleanup of the OpenAPI document (formatting and style)
```

### Output

Each source can specify an output location where the merged OpenAPI document will be written.

```yaml
    output: ./merged-openapi.yaml
```

### Registry

Sources can be configured to publish to the API Registry found in the Speakeasy workspace.

```yaml
    registry:
      location: registry.speakeasy.com/my-org/my-api
```

## Targets

Targets can be added to a workflow programmatically `speakeasy configure targets` or manually by editing the workflow file.

### Targets

Targets are the outputs of the workflow. A single Target is a SDK, Terraform or other generated artifact from sources.

```yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    target: python
    source: my-source
    testing:
      enabled: true
      mockServer:
        enabled: false
```

### TargetName

Each Target is given a name. In this example the name is `my-target`. This name is used to reference the target in the workflow file.

```yaml
  my-target:
```

### TargetType

Each Target has a type. The target is the type of artifact that will be generated from the sources. The target can be one of the supported languages [here](/docs/sdks/create-client-sdks)

```yaml
    target: python
```

### TargetSource

Each Target has a source. The source is the name of the source that the target will be generated from.

```yaml
    source: my-source
```

### Testing

Each Target supports enabling testing as part of the workflow, if test generation is licensed. This will run target-specific testing, such as `go test` or `pytest`, after code generation. Use this with CLI-only `speakeasy run` development workflows (instead of separately calling `speakeasy test`) or GitHub Actions `mode: direct` or `mode: test` development workflows to ensure tests are successful with any potential code updates.

```yaml
    testing:
      enabled: true
      mockServer:
        enabled: false
```

### MockServer

Target testing, when licensed and enabled, starts a mock API server automatically as part of the workflow. This disables the mock API server, if the testing should always pointed at a test environment server URL instead.

```yaml
      mockServer:
        enabled: false
```

### CodeSamples

Each target can be configured to generate code samples and publish them to Speakeasy's registry.

```yaml
    codeSamples:
      output: codeSamples.yaml
      registry:
        location: registry.speakeasy.com/my-org/my-api/code-samples
```
