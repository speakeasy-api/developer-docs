# Iterate on your OpenAPI document with the OpenAPI Editor

The Speakeasy OpenAPI Editor provides a web-based interface for editing and managing OpenAPI specifications. The editor includes real-time validation, AI-powered suggestions, and a non-destructive overlay system that preserves source integrity while enabling customization.

## Edit with the overlay system

The overlay system captures all changes as separate transformations that reapply automatically when the source specification regenerates. This approach prevents customizations from being overwritten.

### How overlays work

When editing a field:

1. Changes save as an overlay, not as direct modifications to the source
2. The overlay system tracks the specific path and transformation
3. On source regeneration, overlays reapply automatically
4. Conflicts surface in the editor for manual resolution

This system is particularly useful for teams using code-first API development, where specifications generate from source code but require additional documentation or examples.

For more information on OpenAPI Overlays, see [here](/docs/prep-openapi/overlays/create-overlays).

## Lint and validate specifications

The editor provides real-time linting and validation to catch errors and improve specification quality.

### Built-in validation

Automatic validation catches common issues:

- **Syntax errors**: Invalid YAML or JSON structure
- **Schema violations**: Fields that don't conform to OpenAPI specification
- **Reference errors**: Broken `$ref` pointers to components
- **Semantic issues**: Logical inconsistencies like duplicate operation IDs

Errors and warnings appear inline in the editor and in the validation panel. Select any issue to jump directly to the problematic line.

For a full list of linting rules please see, [here](/docs/prep-openapi/linting).

## Preview Artifact changes

The preview pane displays how specification changes affect generated SDKs and documentation in real-time.

### Available preview modes

Toggle between preview modes to explore the different types of artifacts you can generate:

- **SDKs**: Generated client libraries in supported languages
- **MCP servers**: Method signatures, parameters, and return types
- **Terraform (Coming Soon!)**: Resource definitions and usage examples 

Changes made to the spec in the editor update the preview instantly, providing immediate feedback on how modifications affect the developer experience.

### Multi-language preview

Select target languages to preview SDK generation across different programming environments:

The preview uses the same generation logic as production SDK builds, ensuring accuracy.

## Next steps

The OpenAPI Editor streamlines specification management through its overlay system, real-time validation, and instant SDK preview capabilities. Import specifications from any source, edit safely with non-destructive overlays, and validate changes before SDK generation. The editor integrates seamlessly into existing CLI workflows, requiring no changes to build pipelines or development processes.
