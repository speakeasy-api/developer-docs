Here you'll find detailed guides on how to quickly get connected to your Gram
MCP servers in different ways.

Specifically we provide detailed instructions on:

- Connecting with GUI MCP Clients such as [Using Claude Desktop with Gram-hosted MCP servers](/docs/mcp/build/integrate/clients/using-claude-desktop-with-gram-mcp-server).
- Connecting with CLI tools such as [Using Claude Code with Gram-hosted MCP servers](/docs/mcp/build/integrate/clients/using-claude-code-with-gram-mcp-servers).
- Using MCP programmatically through APIs such as [Using OpenAI API with Gram-hosted MCP servers](/docs/mcp/build/integrate/api-clients/using-openai-api-with-gram-mcp-servers).
- [Exporting server configuration](/docs/mcp/build/integrate/export-server-configuration) as JSON for documentation and integration.
- Building example applications like [Add AI chat to an existing app](/docs/mcp/build/examples/adding-ai-chat-to-your-app).
