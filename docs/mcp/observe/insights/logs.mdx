import { Callout } from "@/mdx/components";

The Logs page displays tool call traces across all deployments in a project. Each trace groups related log records for a single tool invocation, making it easy to debug issues and understand tool behavior.

- **Tool call traces** - Each row represents a tool invocation with its timestamp, tool name, and HTTP status
- **Log details** - Click a trace to view the full log message, severity, and structured attributes
- **Trace context** - W3C trace_id and span_id for correlating with distributed tracing systems

## AI-powered exploration

Use the chat interface to ask questions about logs in natural language:

- "Show me all failed tool calls in the last hour"
- "What errors happened for the search tool today?"
- "Find traces with high latency"

## Filtering

Filter traces by tool URN, time range, deployment, or user identity.
