# Create Ruby SDKs from OpenAPI documents

## Ruby SDK overview

The Speakeasy Ruby SDK is designed to be easy to use and debug, and uses modern, object-oriented programming in ruby for a robust and strongly-typed experience.

Some core features of the SDK are:

- Our custom Crystalline serialization/deserialization library, using the object oriented structure of your api components to provide a totally ruby-native object oriented interface to your api
- Configure your api interactions at the SDK level or per operation, using simple class constructors and function parameters
- Initial support for security.  This includes complete support for simple security patterns, and built in support for some common OAuth flows and other standard security mechanisms.
- SDK Hooks to allow custom behaviour at various stages of the request response cycle.

## Flexible Type Safety

Type safety in ruby is a controversial topics, with no typing approach being universally accepted by the community.  Therefore instead of making an executive decision, you can specify your preferred `typingStrat` in your `gen.yaml` file.

### No Type Safety

If you want Speakeasy to generate an SDK that does not include any typing directives, specifying a `typingStrat` of 'none'.

Please note that even in this mode, the Crystalline serialization/deserialization library will necessarily do some type checking as it's processing requests and responses.

### Sorbet Mode

If, however, you prefer for Speakeasy to generate an SDK that includes thorough type checking, specify a `typingStrat` of `sorbet`.

In this mode, all methods and classes, etc will be annotated with the corresponding `sig` directives.  In addition, `sorbet` will be added as a dependency for your project, and at compilation, a full static typecheck will be run.


## External libraries

The Speakeasy ruby SDK seeks to support the majority of the OpenAPI Specification features, and as such, supports some features that aren't contained in the ruby standard library.

Speakeasy fills the gaps using some external dependencies, which are detailed below.

### HTTP

For rich support of HTTP processing, retries, form handling, etc.  we take advantage of the excellent [Faraday](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/#/) library, along with two of it's companion libraries [Faraday Retry](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday-retry) and [Faraday Multipart](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday-multipart).

### Base64

Since Ruby 3, the stdlib no longer includes base64 functionality, so we require this related package.

### Linting With Rubocop

We include rubocop as a development dependency, and ensure that all of our builds pass a lot of the linter checks.

### Tests

[Mini Test](https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest/versions/5.25.5?locale=en) is included with the SDK for running tests. However, no tests are created for the SDK automatically.

## Ruby SDK data types and classes

The Speakeasy Ruby SDK uses native types wherever possible:

- `String`
- `Date`
- `DateTime`
- `Integer`
- `Float`
- `TrueClass` & `FalseClass`

SDK Components are generated as ruby classes, and use a simple DSL to publicly declare the fields and types of fields as found in the sdk.

## Parameters

When configured, Speakeasy will include up to a specified number of parameters directly in the function signatures, rather than providing the list of parameters as an object to be passed to the operation methods.

The maximum number of parameters to be placed in the method signature is set in the `maxMethodParams` option in the `gen.yaml` file. If `maxMethodParams` is not set or is set to `0`, no method parameters will be added.

## Errors

The Speakeasy ruby SDK raises exceptions using the appropriate `error` class as defined in the sdk specification. Wrap requests in a `begin` block to handle the error in the response.

## User agent strings

The ruby SDK includes a [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) string in all requests, which can be leveraged to track SDK usage amongst broader API usage. The format is as follows:

```stmpl
speakeasy-sdk/ruby {{SDKVersion}} {{GenVersion}} {{DocVersion}} {{PackageName}}
```

- `SDKVersion` is the version of the SDK defined in `gen.yaml` and released.
- `GenVersion` is the version of the Speakeasy generator.
- `DocVersion` is the version of the OpenAPI document.
- `PackageName` is the name of the package defined in `gen.yaml`.

## Feature examples

Let's take a look at how OpenAPI features are mapped to ruby code. We'll use snippets from the [Swagger PetStore 3.1](https://petstore31.swagger.io/) OpenAPI document, [`openapi.yaml`](https://petstore31.swagger.io/api/v31/openapi.yaml). If you're not familiar with the example, it provides operations for managing users, customers, pets, and orders for pets in a hypothetical pet store.

### Tags

Each `tag` in the OpenAPI document becomes a sub-sdk, captured in it's own file, containing all tagged operations, such as `pet.rb`, `store.rb`, and `user.rb` for:

```yaml
tags:
  - name: pet
    description: Everything about your Pets
    externalDocs:
      description: Find out more
      url: http://swagger.io
...
```

### Security

The Swagger Petstore OpenAPI document uses API key security and OAuth 2.0:

```yaml
/pet/{petId}:
 security:
    - api_key: []
    - petstore_auth:
        - write:pets
        - read:pets
...
components:
  securitySchemes:
    petstore_auth:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        implicit:
          authorizationUrl: https://petstore31.swagger.io/oauth/authorize
          scopes:
            write:pets: modify pets in your account
            read:pets: read your pets
    api_key:
      type: apiKey
      name: api_key
      in: header
```

The ruby SDK creates a security class you can call with either scheme:

```ruby
class GetPetByIdSecurity
    include Crystalline::MetadataFields

    field :api_key, Crystalline::Nilable.new(::String), {'security': {'scheme': true, 'type': 'apiKey', 'subtype': 'header', 'name': 'api_key'}}
    field :pet_store_auth, Crystalline::Nilable.new(::String), {'security': {'scheme': true,'type': 'oauth2','name': 'Authorization'} }

    def initialize(api_key: nil, pet_store_auth: nil)
        @api_key = api_key
        @pet_store_auth = pet_store_auth
    end
end

# Example call:

request_security = GetPetByIdSecurity.new(api_key: '<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>');
response = sdk.pet.get_pet_by_id(request_security, 504151);
```

The implicit flow is the only OAuth flow currently supported.

### Enums

Speakeasy uses sorbet `T::Enum` enums, if sorbet is the typing strategy:

```ruby
class Status < T::Enum
  enums do
    AVAILABLE = new('available')
    PENDING = new('pending')
    SOLD = new('sold')
  end
end
```

If you are not using sorbet, Crystalline provides a suitable mixin:

```ruby
class Status
  include ::Crystalline::Enum
  enums do
    AVAILABLE = new('available')
    PENDING = new('pending')
    SOLD = new('sold')
  end
end
```



### Typed parameters

Consider the following example of an array of strings in `openapi.yaml`:

```yaml
/pet/findByTags:
 get:
   operationId: findPetsByTags
   parameters:
      - name: tags
        in: query
        required: false
        explode: true
        schema:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
```

The ruby SDK provides sorbet types in a signature block.

```ruby
sig { params(tags: T.nilable(T::Array[::String])).returns(FindPetsByTagsResponse) }
def find_pets_by_tags(tags: nil)
```

You can use `oneOf` in an OpenAPI document like this:

```yaml
Pet:
  type: object
  properties:
    age:
      oneOf:
      - type: integer
      - type: string
```

The `age` property will be typed as a union in ruby:


```ruby
  field age T.nilable(T.any(::Integer,::String))
```
