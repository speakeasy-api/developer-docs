# Create Unity SDKs from OpenAPI / Swagger

## Unity SDK Overview

The Speakeasy Unity C# SDK supports Unity 2021.3 LTS and above and is designed to be strongly typed, light on external dependencies, easy to debug, and easy to use.

Some of the core features of the SDK include:

- Interfaces for core components allow for dependency injection and mocking.
- Generated C# doc comments to enhance the SDK's IntelliSense compatibility and developer experience.
- Async/await support for all API calls, which can easily be wrapped in coroutines if needed.
- Optional pagination support for supported APIs.
- Support for complex number types:
  - `System.Numbers.BigInteger`
  - `System.Decimal`
- Support for both string- and integer-based enums.
- Streaming downloads for files.

The SDK includes minimal dependencies. The only external dependencies are:

- `newtonsoft.json` for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- The UnityEngine libraries.

|   ├── {SDK Class Name}.csproj

|   ├── ...                      # Other SDK classes
|   ├── Models                   # The namespace for the SDK's models

└── ...
```

## HTTP Client

The Unity C# SDK provides an interface for the HTTP client used to make API calls. A custom HTTP client can be provided to the SDK as long as it conforms to the interface.

```csharp
public interface ISpeakeasyHttpClient
{
    void AddHeader(string key, string value);
    void AddQueryParam(string key, string value);
    Task<UnityWebRequest> SendAsync(UnityWebRequest message);
}
```

By default, the SDK will instantiate its own client using `UnityWebRequest.SendWebRequest()` to send the request, but this can be overridden by providing a custom implementation of the `ISpeakeasyHttpClient` interface:

```csharp
var client = new CustomHttpClient();

var sdkInstance = new SDK(client);
```

This is useful if you're using a custom HTTP client that supports `UnityWebRequests` and a proxy or other custom configuration, or to provide a client preconfigured with standard headers.

## Data Types and Classes

The C# SDK uses as many native types from the standard library as possible, for example:

- `string`
- `System.DateTime`
- `int`
- `long`
- `System.Numberics.BigInteger`
- `float`
- `double`
- `decimal`
- `bool`


The SDK will only fall back on custom types when the native types are not suitable, for example:

- A custom `DateOnly` class for `date` types
- Custom `enum` types for `string` and `integer` based enums

Speakeasy will generate standard C# classes with public fields that use attributes to guide the serialization and deserialization processes.

The classes are also `Serializable`, with `[SerializeField]` attributes on the fields allowing them to be used in the Unity Inspector.

## Parameters

If parameters are defined in the OpenAPI document, Speakeasy will generate methods with parameters.

The number of parameters defined should not exceed the `maxMethodParams` value configured in the `gen.yaml` file. If they do or the `maxMethodParams` value is set to `0`, Speakeasy will generate a request object that allows for all parameters to be passed in a single object.

## Async Support

The Unity C# SDK is generated with async/await support for all API calls, which can easily be wrapped in coroutines if needed. For example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

// Static methods that help using the SDK in Unity coroutines
public static class CoroutineHelper
{
    public static IEnumerator Await(Task task)
    {
        while (!task.IsCompleted)
        {
            yield return null;
        }
        if (task.IsFaulted)
        {
            throw task.Exception;
        }
    }

    public static IEnumerator Await(Func<Task> taskDelegate)
    {
        return Await(taskDelegate.Invoke());
    }
}
```

The example above can be used like so:

```csharp
yield return CoroutineHelper.Await(async () =>
{
    var sdk = new SDK();

    using (
        var res = await sdk.SomeMethod(...)
    )
    {
        // Handle response
    }
});
```

Due to the nature of the underlying `UnityWebRequest`, the response is an `IDisposable` object that should be disposed of when finished with or used within a `using` statement as shown above.

## Errors

The Unity C# SDK will throw exceptions for network or invalid request errors.

For unsuccessful responses, the SDK will return a response object containing the status code and response body, which can be checked for the status of the method call.

Support for throwing unsuccessful status codes as exceptions is coming soon.

## User Agent Strings

The Unity SDK will include a [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) string in all requests that can be leveraged for tracking SDK usage amongst broader API usage. The format is as follows: 

```stmpl
speakeasy-sdk/unity {{SDKVersion}} {{GenVersion}} {{DocVersion}} {{PackageName}}
```
Where
- `SDKVersion` is the version of the SDK, defined in `gen.yaml` and released
- `GenVersion` is the version of the Speakeasy generator
- `DocVersion` is the version of the OpenAPI document
- `PackageName` is the name of the package defined in `gen.yaml`
