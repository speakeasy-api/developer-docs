# Language maturity concepts

Speakeasy creates and maintains SDKs (generation targets) for your API. This page explains the terminology used to describe these generation targets.

## Maturity levels

<Table 
  data={[
    { level: "Alpha", description: "An early preview of upcoming features intended for gathering feedback. Alpha versions are less complete and likely to be unstable, with frequent updates and significant changes." },
    { level: "Beta", description: "A pre-release version that includes many features of GA but is still subject to significant modifications based on user feedback. The interface is considered stable enough for testing." },
    { level: "General availability (GA)", description: "A fully supported release that includes all functionalities altering the type interface from OpenAPI Specification keywords (for example, [`oneOf`](/docs/customize-sdks/oneof))." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "level", header: "Maturity level" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

## Feature support levels

Feature support levels indicate the extent of additional functionalities provided.

<Table 
  data={[
    { level: "Gold", description: "Indicates full feature support, including all opt-in enhancements such as [Pagination](/docs/customize-sdks/pagination), [Retries](/docs/customize-sdks/retries), [Server Templates](/docs/customize-sdks/server-templates), and [OneOf](/docs/customize-sdks/oneof)." },
    { level: "Level 2", description: "Extends the type interface by synthesizing multiple API calls into single interactions. This is achieved using specified [links](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#link-object) in the OpenAPI spec." },
    { level: "Level 1", description: "Provides essential functionalities and basic support without the advanced features found in Gold or Level 2. Targets with Standard support are stable and reliable but do not include advanced features." }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "level", header: "Feature support level" },
    { key: "description", header: "Description" }
  ]}
/>

## Target language support

<Table 
  data={[
    { target: "[TypeScript](/docs/languages/typescript/methodology-ts)", maturity: "GA", support: "Gold" },
    { target: "[Go](/docs/languages/golang/methodology-go)", maturity: "GA", support: "Gold" },
    { target: "[Java](/docs/languages/java/methodology-java)", maturity: "GA", support: "Gold" },
    { target: "[Python - Pydantic & Async](/docs/languages/python/methodology-python)", maturity: "GA", support: "Gold" },
    { target: "[C#](/docs/languages/csharp/methodology-csharp)", maturity: "GA", support: "Gold" },
    { target: "[Terraform](/docs/create-terraform)", maturity: "GA", support: "Level 2" },
    { target: "[PHP](/docs/languages/php/methodology-php)", maturity: "GA", support: "Level 1" },
    { target: "[Unity](/docs/languages/unity/methodology-unity)", maturity: "Beta", support: "Level 1" },
    { target: "[PHP](/docs/languages/php/methodology-php)", maturity: "Beta", support: "Level 1" },
    { target: "[Ruby](/docs/languages/ruby/methodology-ruby)", maturity: "Alpha", support: "Level 1" },
    { target: "Postman", maturity: "Alpha", support: "Level 1" }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "target", header: "Target" },
    { key: "maturity", header: "Maturity level" },
    { key: "support", header: "Feature support level" }
  ]}
/>
