# Our Design Philosophy

SDKs are a critical interface for an API. We therefore put a lot of thought into what the developer experience should be:

- **Type safe** - The SDKs we generate are fully typed, ensuring customers can catch errors early and often.
- **Human readable** - The SDKs we generate are easy for developers to read and debug in the customer's IDE. We avoid convoluted abstractions.
- **Batteries-included** - The SDKs we generate include everything from telemetry and retries to pagination.
- **Fault tolerant** - Our generator is easy to use and outputs usable SDKs wherever possible. If we can't output a working SDK, we will validate your OpenAPI spec and alert you of the problems.
- **Beyond OpenAPI** - Our generator covers OpenAPI and can extend where OpenAPI falls short.
- **Minimal dependencies** - Our SDKs are meant to be powerful but lean. We start with native language libraries and layer on third-party libraries only when the customer benefits far outweigh the cost of the extra dependency. We avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.
