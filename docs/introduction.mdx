# Introduction to Speakeasy

Speakeasy is a platform that provides API developers with tools, workflows, and infrastructure to create APIs optimized for both developers and LLMs.

With Speakeasy, you can create SDKs, agent tools, API documentation, and more.

## Why APIs matter

APIs are a powerful force for innovation. One team solves a problem, exposes an API, and every engineer (or AI agent) benefits from their work. That means more time spent tackling new problems, and less time reinventing the wheel.

The problem is that most APIs are bad.

The tools and practices for building quality, reliable APIs hasn't kept pace with the central role APIs play in modern software development.

That's the problem Speakeasy exists to solve.
