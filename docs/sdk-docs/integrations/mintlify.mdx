# Integrate Speakeasy with Mintlify

---

Autogenerated code snippets from Speakeasy SDKs can be integrated directly into Mintlify API reference documentation. SDK usage snippets are shown in the [interactive playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of Mintlify-powered documentation sites.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Mintlify with Speakeasy, you'll need the following:

- A [Mintlify documentation repository](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart#creating-the-repository).
- A Speakeasy-generated SDK with a configured [automated code sample URL](/docs/sdk-docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls).

## Setting up the integration

### Update the configuration file

Add the combined spec URL to **Anchors** or **Tabs** in the `docs.json` configuration file of a Mintlify repository.

**Note:** Mintlify now uses `docs.json` as the primary configuration file. If you're still using the legacy `mint.json` format, follow the [migration guide](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings#upgrading-from-mintjson) to upgrade to `docs.json`.

#### Using docs.json

Add the combined spec URL to **Anchors** by updating the `anchor` field in the `docs.json` file as follows:

```json filename="docs.json"
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add the combined spec URL to **Tabs** by updating the `tab` field in the `docs.json` file as follows:

```json filename="docs.json"
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "url": "api-reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Migrating from mint.json

If you're using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, upgrade to `docs.json` using the Mintlify CLI:

```bash
mint upgrade
```

This command creates a `docs.json` file from your existing `mint.json`. After verifying the configuration, delete the old `mint.json` file.

Speakeasy-generated code snippets can now be viewed in the Mintlify API reference documentation. See the code snippets in action in the [interactive playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of the Mintlify-powered documentation site.

## Next steps

Mintlify offers flexible customization options for API references generated from OpenAPI documents. For more information, refer to the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup).
