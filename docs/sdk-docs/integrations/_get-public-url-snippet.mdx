### Get the API's combined spec public URL from the registry

Navigate to the [Speakeasy Dashboard](https://app.speakeasy.com) and open the **API Registry** overview. Select the relevant API and open the entry labeled with type `Combined Spec`. This is typically at the bottom under "Related Documents".

> NOTE: If the entry is not labeled **Combined Spec**, ensure that the API
> has an [automatic code sample
> URL](/docs/sdk-docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls) configured.

From the registry entry's page, copy the provided public URL using the "Share" button on the top right.
