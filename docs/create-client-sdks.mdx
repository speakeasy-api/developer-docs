# SDK Creation Overview

<IconGrid { ...SupportedLanguagesData } />

## Prerequisites

- Install the Speakeasy CLI using one of the following methods:

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install speakeasy-api/homebrew-tap/speakeasy

# Script Installation (macOS and Linux)
curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh

# Windows Installation
# Using winget:
winget install speakeasy

# Using Chocolatey:
choco install speakeasy
```

For manual installation, download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/releases), extract the binary, and add it to the system path.

- Provide an API specification in one of the supported formats:

| Spec Format         | Supported |
| ------------------- | :-------: |
| OpenAPI 3.0         |    âœ…     |
| OpenAPI 3.1         |    âœ…     |
| JSON Schema         |    âœ…     |
| Postman Collections |    ðŸ”œ     |

<Callout title="TIP" variant="success">
  If your spec is in an unsupported format, use one of the following tools to convert it:

- [Swagger 2.0 -> OpenAPI 3.0](https://editor.swagger.io/): go to **Edit > Convert to OpenAPI 3.0**
- [Postman -> OpenAPI 3.0](https://kevinswiber.github.io/postman2openapi/)

</Callout>

## Interactive SDK Generation With CLI Quickstart

For first-time SDK generation with Speakeasy, start with `speakeasy quickstart`. Install the Speakeasy CLI using `brew install speakeasy-api/tap/speakeasy`.

Run the following command to start the quickstart process:

```bash
speakeasy quickstart
```

This command initiates an interactive session for SDK generation. The process requires creating a workspace on the [dashboard](https://app.speakeasy.com/).

<Screenshot variant="cli" docs={true}>
  ![Screenshot of the terminal after running speakeasy
  quickstart.](./assets/create-sdks/quickstart-1.png)
</Screenshot>

The next step prompts for SDK language selection:

<Screenshot variant="cli" docs={true}>
  ![Screenshot of the terminal prompting user to select
  language.](./assets/create-sdks/quickstart-2.png)
</Screenshot>

Complete the prompted parameter configuration:

<Screenshot variant="cli" docs={true}>
  ![Screenshot of the terminal with optional
  parameters.](./assets/create-sdks/quickstart-3.png)
</Screenshot>

Speakeasy validates the specifications and generates the SDK after receiving all inputs. The process executes [`speakeasy run`](/docs/speakeasy-reference/cli/run) to validate, generate, compile, and set up the SDK. A confirmation message displays the generated SDK details upon successful completion:

<Screenshot variant="cli" docs={true}>
  ![Screenshot of the terminal showing
  success.](./assets/create-sdks/quickstart-4.png)
</Screenshot>

Re-run the `speakeasy run` command after making changes to the OpenAPI document or SDK configuration.

Set up the SDK on GitHub for a fully managed experience. See the GitHub setup guide [here](/docs/manage/github-setup).

## Traditional SDK Generation

The non-interactive approach allows specifying all parameters in a single command, suitable for script integration and automation. This method requires manual configuration of the workflow to validate, generate, compile, and publish the SDK.

The recommended approach remains using `speakeasy quickstart` and `run` as shown in the [quickstart section](#interactive-sdk-generation-with-cli-quickstart) above.

```shell
speakeasy generate sdk --out <output_directory> --schema <specification_path_or_url> [options]
```

### Required Parameters:

```
--out: Destination for the generated SDK.
--schema: Path or URL to your API spec.
```

### Additional Options

```
  -y, --auto-yes                 auto answer yes to all prompts
  -d, --debug                    enable writing debug files with broken code
  -H, --header string            header key to use if authentication is required for downloading schema from remote URL
  -h, --help                     help for sdk
  -i, --installationURL string   the language specific installation URL for installation instructions if the SDK is not published to a package manager
  -l, --lang string              language to generate sdk for (available options: [csharp, go, java, php, python, ruby, swift, terraform, typescript, unity]) (default "go")
  -p, --published                whether the SDK is published to a package manager or not, determines the type of installation instructions to generate
  -r, --repo string              the repository URL for the SDK, if the published (-p) flag isn't used this will be used to generate installation instructions
  -b, --repo-subdir string       the subdirectory of the repository where the SDK is located in the repo, helps with documentation generation
      --token string             token value to use if authentication is required for downloading schema from remote URL
```

## Next Step: Customize Your SDK

Generating SDKs is the first step but there are several optimizations you can make to improve the quality of your SDKs. Check out the following guide on [customizing your SDKs](/docs/customize-sdks/).
