# Customizing SDK Tests

## Regenerate tests from scratch

By default tests will only be populated from modifications to the `tests.arazzo.yaml` file once they have been boostrapped.
If you would like to regenerate all of your SDK tests from scratch, you can run the following command:

```bash
speakeasy configure tests --rebuild
```


## Disable auto generation of tests for specific operations

When `generateNewTests` is enabled in the `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file, all new operations found on the next generation after they are added will automatically have workflows created for then in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file and therefore tests will be generated for them.

To disable auto generation of tests for specific operations, the `x-speakeasy-test` extension can be added to the operation in the OpenAPI document.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
# ...
paths:
  /example1:
    get:
      x-speakeasy-test: false # Disables auto generation of tests for this operation
      # ...
# ...
```

alternatively if a workflow/test already exists that references the operation in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file, then no new workflow will be created for the operation.


## Grouping tests

By default, all tests will be generated into a single file related to the main SDK class for example `sdk.test.ts` , `test_sdk.py`, or `SDKTest.java`. This can be configured by adding a `x-speakeasy-test-group` extension to the workflow which will determine which tests will be grouped together in seperate test files.

```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-group: user # All tests in the user group will end up in the `user.test.ts`/`test_user.py`/`user_test.go` files
    # ...
```


## Generate tests only for specific targets

By default, all tests will be generated for all supported targets. Using the `x-speakeasy-test-targets` or `x-speakeasy-test-targets-exclude` extensions, it is possible to generate tests only for specific targets. This may be useful if tests are either not needed for certain languages or they may be failing in a certain language.

```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-targets: # Only generate tests for the typescript target
      - typescript
    # ...
```
or
```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-targets-exclude: # generate tests for all languages except typescript
      - typescript
    # ...
```

## Customizing SDK Test Manifests

Directly modifying SDK tests is not common, but you can customize the actual content of an existing SDK test by modifying the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file.
To learn more about these kinds of modifications see [here](/docs/api-contract-tests#writing-custom-end-to-end-tests).
