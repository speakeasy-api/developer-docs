# Customizing SDK Tests

## Disable auto generation of tests for specific operations

When `generateNewTests` is enabled in the `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file, all new operations found on the next generation after they are added will automatically have workflows created for then in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file and therefore tests will be generated for them.

To disable auto generation of tests for specific operations, the `x-speakeasy-test` extension can be added to the operation in the OpenAPI document.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
# ...
paths:
  /example1:
    get:
      x-speakeasy-test: false # Disables auto generation of tests for this operation
      # ...
# ...
```

alternatively if a workflow/test already exists that references the operation in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file, then no new workflow will be created for the operation.


## Grouping tests

By default, all tests will be generated into a single file related to the main SDK class for example `sdk.test.ts` or `test_sdk.py`. This can be configured by adding a `x-speakeasy-test-group` extension to the workflow which will determine which tests will be grouped together in seperate test files.

```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-group: user # All tests in the user group will end up in the `user.test.ts`/`test_user.py`/`user_test.go` files
    # ...
```


## Generate tests only for specific targets

By default, all tests will be generated for all supported targets. But using the `x-speakeasy-test-targets` extension, it is possible to generate tests only for specific targets. This may be useful if tests are either not needed for certain languages or they may be failing in a certain language.

```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-targets: # Only generate tests for the typescript target
      - typescript
    # ...
```

## Data Handling

The definition of each operation will determine what data is used in generated testing. In addition to the [data type system](/openapi/schemas/dataTypes) shaping data, OpenAPI Specification supports [examples](/openapi/examples). Test generation will automatically use defined examples when available. In the absense of defined examples, the test generation will attempt to use a realistic example based on the `type`, `format` (if set), and property name (if applicable).

#### Example Property

By default, a single test will be created based on any `example` properties found throughout any defined operation `parameters`, `requestBody`, and `responses`.

In this example, a single test is created for the `updatePet` operation with `id`, `name`, and `photoUrls` data:

<ScrollyCoding>

### !!steps `paths[/pet].put.operationId`

This test is created for the `updatePet` operation.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(8)
paths:
  "/pet":
    put:
      tags:
      - pet
      summary: Update an existing pet
      description: Update an existing pet by Id
      operationId: updatePet
      requestBody:
        description: Update an existent pet in the store
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
        required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      required:
      - name
      - photoUrls
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
          example: 10
        name:
          type: string
          example: doggie
        category:
          "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Category"
        photoUrls:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
        tags:
          type: array
          items:
            "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Tag"
        status:
          type: string
          description: pet status in the store
          enum:
          - available
          - pending
          - sold
```

---

### !!steps `paths[/pet].put.requestBody`

The operation uses the `Pet` shared component for both the request body and response.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(9,14,16,22)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.required`

The `Pet` shared component is an object type with required `name` and `photoUrls` properties.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(25:29)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.id`

While not required, the `Pet` object `id` property has an `example` property, which will be automatically included in the test.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(31,34)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.name`

The required `Pet` object `name` property has an `example` property, which will be included in the test.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(35,37)
```

---

### !!steps `components.schemas.Pet.photoUrls`

The required `Pet` object `photoUrls` property does not include an `example` property, however it will have an example value automatically created since it is required.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(40:43)
```

---

</ScrollyCoding>

This definition creates a test with `Pet` object request body and response data:

```yaml
id: 10
name: doggie
photoUrls:
  - <value>
```

#### Examples Property

Define multiple tests for an operation using the `examples` property, which in this context is a mapping of example name string keys to example values. Prevent missing or mismatched test generation by ensuring the same example name key is used across all necessary `parameters`, `requestBody`, and `responses` parts of the operation. If desired, [define reusable examples under components](/openapi/examples) similar to schemas.

In this example, multiple tests (`fido` and `rover`) are created for the `addPet` operation:

<ScrollyCoding>

### !!steps `paths[/pet].post.operationId`

These tests are created for the `addPet` operation.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(8)
paths:
  "/pet":
    post:
      tags:
      - pet
      summary: Add a new pet to the store
      description: Add a new pet to the store
      operationId: addPet
      requestBody:
        description: Create a new pet in the store
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
            examples:
              fido:
                summary: fido request
                description: fido example requestBody for test generation
                value:
                  name: Fido
                  photoUrls:
                    - https://www.example.com/fido.jpg
                  status: available
              rover:
                summary: rover request
                description: rover example requestBody for test generation
                value:
                  name: Rover
                  photoUrls:
                    - https://www.example.com/rover1.jpg
                    - https://www.example.com/rover2.jpg
                  status: pending
        required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
              examples:
                fido:
                  summary: fido response
                  description: fido example response for test generation
                  value:
                    id: 1
                    name: Fido
                    photoUrls:
                      - https://www.example.com/fido.jpg
                    status: available
                rover:
                  summary: rover response
                  description: rover example response for test generation
                  value:
                    id: 2
                    name: Rover
                    photoUrls:
                      - https://www.example.com/rover1.jpg
                      - https://www.example.com/rover2.jpg
                    status: pending
```

---

### !!steps `paths[/pet].post.requestBody`

This operation includes both request body and response examples.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(9,15,34,41)
```

---

### !!steps `examples.fido`

An `addPet` operation `fido` test is created with example request body and response data.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(16:23,42:50)
```

---

### !!steps `examples.rover`

An `addPet` operation `rover` test is created with example request body and response data.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
# !focus(24:32,51:60)
```

---

#### Ignoring Data

Data properties can be explicitly ignored in testing via the `x-speakeasy-test-ignore` annotation.

In this example, the `other` property will be omitted from test generation:

```yaml
paths:
  /example:
    get:
      # ... other operation configuration ...
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  data:
                    type: string
                  other:
                    type: string
                    x-speakeasy-test-ignore: true
```
