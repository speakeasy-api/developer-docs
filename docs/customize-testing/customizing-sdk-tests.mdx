# Customizing SDK Tests

## Disable auto generation of tests for specific operations

When `generateNewTests` is enabled in the `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file, all new operations found on the next generation after they are added will automatically have workflows created for then in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file and therefore tests will be generated for them.

To disable auto generation of tests for specific operations, the `x-speakeasy-test` extension can be added to the operation in the OpenAPI document.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
# ...
paths:
  /example1:
    get:
      x-speakeasy-test: false # Disables auto generation of tests for this operation
      # ...
# ...
```

alternatively if a workflow/test already exists that references the operation in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file, then no new workflow will be created for the operation.

## Grouping tests

By default, all tests will be generated into a single file related to the main SDK class for example `sdk.test.ts` , `test_sdk.py`, or `SDKTest.java`. This can be configured by adding a `x-speakeasy-test-group` extension to the workflow which will determine which tests will be grouped together in seperate test files.

```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-group: user # All tests in the user group will end up in the `user.test.ts`/`test_user.py`/`user_test.go` files
    # ...
```

## Generate tests only for specific targets

By default, all tests will be generated for all supported targets. Using the `x-speakeasy-test-targets` or `x-speakeasy-test-targets-exclude` extensions, it is possible to generate tests only for specific targets. This may be useful if tests are either not needed for certain languages or they may be failing in a certain language.

```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-targets: # Only generate tests for the typescript target
      - typescript
    # ...
```

or

```yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
# ...
workflows:
  - workflowId: some-test
    x-speakeasy-test-targets-exclude: # generate tests for all languages except typescript
      - typescript
    # ...
```

## Customizing SDK Test Manifests

Directly modifying SDK tests is not common, but it is possible to customize the actual content of an existing SDK test by modifying the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file.
To learn more about these kinds of modifications see [here](/docs/api-contract-tests#writing-custom-end-to-end-tests).

## Next Steps

- [Setup testing in GitHub Actions](/docs/customize-testing/github-actions)

<Callout title="Bootstrapping tests again from scratch" type="info">
Once the original `tests.arazzo.yaml` document is bootstrapped, the Arazzo document will only be modified automatically when new operations are detected and `generateNewTests: true` is set in your `./speakeasy/gen.yaml`, new tests will be bootstrapped for these new operations. But pre-bootstrapped tests will be left alone.

If you want to bootstrap all workflows in the Arazzo document from scratch again (for example to match changes to operations or examples in your spec), run the following command:

```bash
speakeasy configure tests --rebuild
```

You can also selectively bootstrap individual tests by:

1. Deleting the specific workflow from the arazzo doc in `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml`
2. Removing the corresponding entry in `.speakeasy/gen.lock` under `generatedTests`

For example, to bootstrap a test for the `createLink` operation again, delete its entry in the gen.lock file:

```yaml
generatedTests:
  createLink: "2025-05-21T12:47:33+10:00" # Delete this to bootstrap test again from scratch
```

This approach preserves any other manual changes you've made to your arazzo doc.
