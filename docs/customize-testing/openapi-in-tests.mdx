# OpenAPI Data in Tests

The definition of each operation determines what data is used in generated testing. In addition to the [data type system](/openapi/schemas/dataTypes) shaping data, OpenAPI Specification supports [examples](/openapi/examples). Test generation automatically uses defined examples when available. In the absence of defined examples, test generation attempts to use a realistic example based on the `type`, `format` (if set), and property name (if applicable).

#### Example Property

By default, a single test is created based on any `example` properties found throughout any defined operation `parameters`, `requestBody`, and `responses`.

Consider the below example. The generator traverses the OpenAPI document to create a single test for the `updatePet` operation with `id`, `name`, and `photoUrls` data:

```yaml openapi.yaml
# !focus(8,9,14,16,22,25:29,31,34,35,37,40:43)
paths:
  "/pet":
    put:
      tags:
      - pet
      summary: Update an existing pet
      description: Update an existing pet by Id
      operationId: updatePet
      requestBody:
        description: Update an existent pet in the store
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
        required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      required:
      - name
      - photoUrls
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
          example: 10
        name:
          type: string
          example: doggie
        category:
          "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Category"
        photoUrls:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
        tags:
          type: array
          items:
            "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Tag"
        status:
          type: string
          description: pet status in the store
          enum:
          - available
          - pending
          - sold
```
Here's how the generator parses this example document:

- `paths[/pet].put.updatePet` - The test uses the `updatePet` operationId in the test name.
- `paths[/pet].put.requestBody` - The test uses the `Pet` shared component for both the constructed request body and response object.
- `components.schemas.Pet.required` - The `Pet` shared component is an object type with required `name` and `photoUrls` properties.
- `components.schemas.Pet.id` - While not required, the `Pet` object `id` property has an `example` property, which is automatically included in the test.
- `components.schemas.Pet.name` - The required `Pet` object `name` property has an `example` property, which is included in the test.
- `components.schemas.Pet.photoUrls` - The required `Pet` object `photoUrls` property does not include an `example` property, however it has an example value automatically created since it is required.

This definition creates a test with `Pet` object request body and response data:

```yaml
id: 10
name: doggie
photoUrls:
  - <value>
```

#### Examples Property

Multiple tests for an operation can be defined using the `examples` property, which in this context is a mapping of example name string keys to example values. Prevent missing or mismatched test generation by ensuring the same example name key is used across all necessary `parameters`, `requestBody`, and `responses` parts of the operation. If desired, [define reusable examples under components](/openapi/examples) similar to schemas.

In this example, multiple tests (`fido` and `rover`) are created for the `addPet` operation:

```yaml openapi.yaml
# !focus(15:32,41:60)
paths:
  "/pet":
    post:
      tags:
      - pet
      summary: Add a new pet to the store
      description: Add a new pet to the store
      operationId: addPet
      requestBody:
        description: Create a new pet in the store
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
            examples:
              fido:
                summary: fido request
                description: fido example requestBody for test generation
                value:
                  name: Fido
                  photoUrls:
                    - https://www.example.com/fido.jpg
                  status: available
              rover:
                summary: rover request
                description: rover example requestBody for test generation
                value:
                  name: Rover
                  photoUrls:
                    - https://www.example.com/rover1.jpg
                    - https://www.example.com/rover2.jpg
                  status: pending
        required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
              examples:
                fido:
                  summary: fido response
                  description: fido example response for test generation
                  value:
                    id: 1
                    name: Fido
                    photoUrls:
                      - https://www.example.com/fido.jpg
                    status: available
                rover:
                  summary: rover response
                  description: rover example response for test generation
                  value:
                    id: 2
                    name: Rover
                    photoUrls:
                      - https://www.example.com/rover1.jpg
                      - https://www.example.com/rover2.jpg
                    status: pending
```

#### Ignoring Data

Data properties can be explicitly ignored in testing via the `x-speakeasy-test-ignore` annotation.

In this example, the `other` property is omitted from test generation:

```yaml
paths:
  /example:
    get:
      # ... other operation configuration ...
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  data:
                    type: string
                  other:
                    type: string
                    x-speakeasy-test-ignore: true
```
