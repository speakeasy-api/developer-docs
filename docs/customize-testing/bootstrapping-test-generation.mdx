# Bootstrapping SDK Tests

Automatically generate tests for your SDKs. Speakeasy can boostrap tests for all your operations including any new operations added in the future.

These tests use any examples available in your OpenAPI document if available, or autogenerate examples based on the field name, type, and format of your schemas.

Multiple tests per operation can be configured using the named examples detailed for your parameters, request bodies and responses.

By default these tests will run against a mock server to validate the correctness of your SDK's serialization and deserialization.

Tests are boostrapped into a `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file in your SDK repo. Once the test exists it can be customized from that `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` without being overwritten.

## Prerequisites

The following are requirements for generating tests:

- [Testing feature prerequisites](/docs/testing#prerequisites) are met.

## Enabling Test Generation

Navigate to your SDK repo and run the following command:

```bash
speakeasy configure tests
```

Test generation and mock API server generation will be enabled when the following exist in the `generation` section of the configuration.

```yaml
# !focus(2)
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ... other existing configuration ...
  tests:
    generateNewTests: true
```

When enabling for the first time this will generate tests for all operations in your OpenAPI document.
Then going forward it will only generate tests for any operations not already found in your `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file.


After enabling test generation, if you wish to disable generation of tests for a specific operation, you can explicitly set `x-speakeasy-test: false`:

```yaml
paths:
  /example1:
    get:
      # This operation, without being explicitly disabled, will generate testing.
      # ... operation configuration ...
  /example2:
    get:
      # This operation will not generate testing.
      # ... other operation configuration ...
      x-speakeasy-test: false
```

### Generated Test Location

Generated test files are written in language-specific locations, relative to the root of the SDK:

<Table
  data={[
    { language: "Go", location: "`tests/`" },
    { language: "Python", location: "`tests/`" },
    { language: "TypeScript", location: "`src/__tests__`" },
    { language: "Java", location: "`src/test/java`" }
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "language", header: "Language" },
    { key: "location", header: "Location" }
  ]}
/>

If the mock server is also generated, its output will be in a `mockserver` directory under these locations.
