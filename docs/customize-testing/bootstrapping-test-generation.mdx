# Bootstrapping SDK Tests

Automatically generate tests for SDKs. Speakeasy can boostrap tests for all operations including any new operations added in the future.

These tests use any examples available in the OpenAPI document if available, or autogenerate examples based on the field name, type, and format of schemas.

Multiple tests per operation can be configured using the named examples detailed for parameters, request bodies and responses.

By default these tests will run against a mock server to validate the correctness of the SDK's serialization and deserialization.

Tests are boostrapped into a `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file in the SDK repo. Once the test exists it can be customized from that `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` without being overwritten.

## Prerequisites

The following are requirements for generating tests:

- [Testing feature prerequisites](/docs/testing#prerequisites) are met.

## Enabling Test Generation

Navigate to the SDK repo and run the following command:

```bash
speakeasy configure tests
```

This command will enable both `generateTests` and `generateNewTests` settings in your [`gen.yaml`](/docs/speakeasy-reference/generation/gen-yaml) configuration file.

Test generation and mock API server generation will be enabled when the following exist in the `generation` section of the configuration.

```yaml
# !focus(2:4)
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ... other existing configuration ...
  tests:
    generateTests: true        # Controls whether tests are generated during speakeasy run
    generateNewTests: true     # Controls whether new tests are added for new operations
```

The `generateTests` setting controls whether test generation is enabled when running [`speakeasy run`](/docs/speakeasy-reference/cli/run). When set to `true`, tests defined in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` document will be generated. When set to `false`, tests won't be generated.

The `generateNewTests` setting controls whether new tests are automatically added to the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` document when new operations are found in the OpenAPI specification.

When enabling for the first time this will generate tests for all operations in the OpenAPI document.
Then going forward it will only generate tests for any operations not already found in the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file.

## Disabling test generation

To completely disable test generation, delete the `.speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml` file from your repository:

```bash
rm .speakeasy/tests.arazzo.yaml
```

The existence of this file is what triggers test generation. Once removed, no tests will be generated regardless of your configuration.

### Disable test generation for specific operations

After enabling test generation, to disable generation of tests for a specific operation, explicitly set `x-speakeasy-test: false`:

```yaml
paths:
  /example1:
    get:
      # This operation, without being explicitly disabled, will generate testing.
      # ... operation configuration ...
  /example2:
    get:
      # This operation will not generate testing.
      # ... other operation configuration ...
      x-speakeasy-test: false
```

### Generated Test Location

Generated test files are written in language-specific locations, relative to the root of the SDK:

<Table
  data={[
    { language: "Go", location: "`tests/`" },
    { language: "Python", location: "`tests/`" },
    { language: "TypeScript", location: "`src/__tests__`" },
    { language: "Java", location: "`src/test/java`" },
  ]}
  columns={[
    { key: "language", header: "Language" },
    { key: "location", header: "Location" },
  ]}
/>

If the mock server is also generated, its output will be in a `mockserver` directory under these locations.
