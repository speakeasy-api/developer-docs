# Use Custom HTTP Clients

SDK users can provide a custom HTTP client when initializing SDKs. This is useful for modifying or debugging requests and responses in flight.

See below for per-language examples:

     \`Do(*http.Request) (*http.Response, error)\` method similar 
     to the standard library's \`http.Client\`. */

  // A custom HTTP client that implements caching
  c := NewCachedClient(&http.Client{}, cache)

  opts := []sdk.SDKOption{
      sdk.WithClient(c),
  }

  s := sdk.New(opts)`,
