# Disabling barrel files

By default, the SDK generator creates **barrel files** (`index.ts` files) that centralize module re-exports within an SDK package.

## Configuring barrel file generation

The `useIndexModules` configuration option controls barrel file generation. Configure this option by adding or modifying `useIndexModules` under the `typescript` section in the `gen.yaml` file:

```yaml filename="<sdk-root>/.speakeasy/gen.yaml"
typescript:
  # add or modify `useIndexModules`
  useIndexModules: true # or false
  # other TypeScript configuration options...
```

By default, `useIndexModules` is set to `true` so that Speakeasy generates barrel files that look like this:

```typescript filename="<sdk-root>/src/models/errors/index.ts"
// petstore sdk
export * from "./apierror.js";
export * from "./apierrorinvalidinput.js";
export * from "./apierrornotfound.js";
export * from "./apierrorunauthorized.js";
export * from "./httpclienterrors.js";
export * from "./sdkvalidationerror.js";
```

SDK consumers can then import modules from barrel files as follows:

```typescript filename="example.ts"
// somewhere in a consumer's code
import {
  ApiErrorInvalidInput,
  ApiErrorNotFound,
  ApiErrorUnauthorized,
  SDKValidationError,
} from "petstore/models/errors";
```

If you set `useIndexModules` to `false`, Speakeasy will not generate these barrel files. Consumers need to import modules directly from the individual module files:

```typescript filename="example.ts" 
// somewhere in a consumer's code
import { ApiErrorInvalidInput } from "petstore/models/errors/apierrorinvalidinput.js";
import { ApiErrorNotFound } from "petstore/models/errors/apierrornotfound.js";
import { ApiErrorUnauthorized } from "petstore/models/errors/apierrorunauthorized.js";
import { SDKValidationError } from "petstore/models/errors/sdkvalidationerror.js";
```

## Pros and cons of using barrel files

Barrel files provide a convenient way to centralize imports for SDK consumers. When `useIndexModules` is `true`, users can use a single entry point to import modules, rather than having to supply the exact file structure of the package's resources.

On the other hand, disabling barrel files has some advantages:

- **Superior tree shaking performance**: Barrel files can significantly impair effective tree shaking in modern bundlers. When importing modules from a barrel file, bundlers often struggle to determine which exports are actually used, leading to the inclusion of unused code. Disabling barrel files allows bundlers to accurately track dependencies and exclude unused code, resulting in smaller production bundles.
- **Enhanced developer tooling**: Without barrel files, IDE "Go to Definition" features (for example, `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + Click) link directly to the source file containing the implementation, rather than through an intermediate barrel file. This improves code navigation and makes it easier to understand the codebase structure.
- **Faster build performance**: Barrel files create additional import chains that build tools have to process. When you remove these intermediary files:

  - Build tools process fewer files during compilation
  - Module dependency graphs become simpler and more efficient
  - Hot module replacement (HMR) becomes more precise
  - TypeScript type checking performance improves

<Callout title="Performance tip" type="info">
  Disabling barrel files provides optimal tree shaking performance when combined
  with `moduleFormat: dual`. The ESM format&apos;s static analysis capabilities
  work best with direct imports, allowing bundlers to eliminate unused code more
  effectively.

## Making the right choice

Whether you should use `useIndexModules` depends on your project's priorities:

- **Disable barrel files** (`useIndexModules: false`) when:

  - Bundle size optimization is critical
  - You're using modern bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite
  - Build performance is important
  - Your team values clear dependency paths

- **Keep barrel files** (`useIndexModules: true`) when:

  - Import convenience is more important than bundle optimization
  - Your project doesn't use a bundler with tree shaking
  - You prefer centralized import management

<Callout title="Recommendation" type="info">
  For modern web applications, we recommend setting `useIndexModules: false`.
  While barrel files offer convenient imports, the performance benefits of
  direct imports typically outweigh this convenience, especially when using
  modern IDEs with good import management features.
