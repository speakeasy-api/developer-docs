# Customize imports

Speakeasy allows customization of the paths for generated models and model imports.

By default, Speakeasy uses an OpenAPI-based naming scheme for the namespaces models are bucketed into, for example:

<Callout title="Info" type="info">
Currently only supported for C#, Go, Python, TypeScript, and Unity SDKs. More languages will be added soon.
</Callout>

### Components

Models generated from components are placed in the `models/components` directory, or the target language idiomatic equivalent.

```yaml
sdk/
├─ models/
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ user.ts
│  │  ├─ drink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  ├─ operations/
│  │  ├─ getuser.ts
│  │  ├─ updateuser.ts
│  │  ├─ getdrink.ts
│  │  ├─ updatedrink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ errors/
│     ├─ sdkerror.ts
│     ├─ responseerror.ts
│     └─ ...
└─ ...
```

### Operations

Models generated from operations are placed in the `models/operations` directory, or the target language idiomatic equivalent.

```yaml
sdk/
├─ models/
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ user.ts
│  │  ├─ drink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  ├─ operations/
│  │  ├─ getuser.ts
│  │  ├─ updateuser.ts
│  │  ├─ getdrink.ts
│  │  ├─ updatedrink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ errors/
│     ├─ sdkerror.ts
│     ├─ responseerror.ts
│     └─ ...
└─ ...
```

### Errors

Models that are used in error status codes are placed in the `models/errors` directory (or the idiomatic equivalent for the target language).

```yaml
sdk/
├─ models/
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ user.ts
│  │  ├─ drink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  ├─ operations/
│  │  ├─ getuser.ts
│  │  ├─ updateuser.ts
│  │  ├─ getdrink.ts
│  │  ├─ updatedrink.ts
│  │  └─ ...
│  └─ errors/
│     ├─ sdkerror.ts
│     ├─ responseerror.ts
│     └─ ...
└─ ...
```

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
  The default names for the model directories are consistent across most target
  languages, but C# makes the exception that the `models/Operations` directory
  is called `models/Requests` by default.
</Callout>

## Customize import paths

### imports

Customize where path models are generated to and imported from by modifying the configuration in the `gen.yaml` file.

Configuration like what is shown will result in a file structure as above.

```yaml
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ...
typescript:
  version: 1.0.0
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models/callbacks
      errors: models/errors
      operations: models/operations
      shared: models/components
      webhooks: models/webhooks
  # ...
```

### option

The `option` key determines the type of bucketing scheme that is used for the models.

Only `openapi` is currently supported. This will bucket models into `components`, `operations`, `errors`, `callbacks`, and `webhooks` directories.

```yaml
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ...
typescript:
  version: 1.0.0
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models/callbacks
      errors: models/errors
      operations: models/operations
      shared: models/components
      webhooks: models/webhooks
  # ...
```

### paths

The `paths` section contains a map of bucket names to paths relative to the root of the generated SDK.

- `shared` refers to the models generated from the `components` section of the OpenAPI specification. (Note: `shared` is a legacy name for the bucket, retained for backward compatibility.)
- `operations` refers to the models generated for the request and responses of operations in the OpenAPI specification.
- `errors` refers to the models generated for schemas referenced in error status codes responses.
- `callbacks` refers to models generated for schemas within the `callbacks` section of an operation.
- `webhooks` refers to models generated from the `webhooks` section of an OpenAPI 3.1 document.

```yaml
configVersion: 2.0.0
generation:
  # ...
typescript:
  version: 1.0.0
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models/callbacks
      errors: models/errors
      operations: models/operations
      shared: models/components
      webhooks: models/webhooks
  # ...
```

You can customize these paths to any path that exists relative to the root of the SDK.

<Callout title="Caution" type="warning">
  If you are providing custom path names, make sure there is no conflict with
  any of the existing directories in the SDK. Conflicts will result in
  compilation issues.
</Callout>

Different buckets can also be configured to use the same path, for example:

```yaml filename="gen.yaml"
typescript:
  ...
  imports:
    option: openapi
    paths:
      callbacks: models
      errors: models
      operations: models
      shared: models
      webhooks: models
```

This will result in all models being generated to the `models` directory. The generator will then resolve any class name conflicts by prefixing or suffixing class names to ensure they are unique.

## Customize global imports

You can configure the generator to work with a global import path for all models.

For example:

```typescript
import { User, GetDrinkRequest, SDK } from "@speakeasy/bar";
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { SDK } from "@speakeasy/bar";
import { User } from "@speakeasy/bar/dist/models/components/user";
import { GetDrinkRequest } from "@speakeasy/bar/dist/models/operations/user";
```

You will configure global imports slightly differently for different languages:

<Callout title="Caution" type="warning">
Global imports will cause namespace pollution for the import and file clutter in the directory models are generated to. 
<br />
Large APIs containing many models (especially many inline models) will inevitably lead to name conflicts. Rename types verbosely to ensure each class is unique within the namespace.
