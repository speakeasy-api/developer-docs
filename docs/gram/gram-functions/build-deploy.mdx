Deploying Gram Functions is as simple as writing them. Deploying will upload your code to Gram and create the tools you've defined.
You can then take advantage of all the Gram platform offers to host your tools as MCP servers, combine them into toolsets, build multi-tool workflows, and more.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  Your functions to not need to be organized as a single MCP server. They will be deployed to Gram as individual tools that can be split apart or combined into MCP servers in the Gram dashboard.
</Callout> 


## Build

To build your tools, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your tools into a zip file that can be deployed to Gram.

## Deploy

To deploy your tools to Gram, run the following command:

```bash
npm run push
```

This will upload your tools to Gram and create the tools you've defined. In the [Gram Dashboard](https://app.getgram.ai), you will see the function source you just uploaded and the tools it created.

## Next steps

Now that you've deployed your tools, you can start using them in MCP servers, combine them into toolsets, build multi-tool workflows, and more. Head to the [Build MCP](/docs/gram/build-mcp/custom-toolsets) documentation to learn more.
