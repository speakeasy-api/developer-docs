## Authentication

To use the Gram Agents API, create a Chat API key in the Gram dashboard and include it in requests.

### Creating a Chat API key

In the [Gram dashboard](https://app.getgram.ai), navigate to **Settings** and create a new API key with chat permissions.

### Request headers

Include the following headers with each request:

```yaml
Content-Type: application/json
Gram-Key: <your-chat-api-key>
Gram-Project: <your-project-slug>
```

The `Gram-Project` header specifies which project the request is associated with. Use `default` if not using multiple projects.

## Billing

Gram Agents API usage is billed as chat usage, similar to Playground usage. Model costs are tracked and billed based on the tokens consumed during agent execution.

### Usage limits

Default account chat credit limits apply to Gram Agents API requests. 

<Callout type="info">
To request higher limits upgrade your account or contact [gram@speakeasy.com](mailto:gram@speakeasy.com).

### Monitoring usage

Track Gram Agents API usage in the [Gram dashboard](https://app.getgram.ai/billing) under **Billing**.
