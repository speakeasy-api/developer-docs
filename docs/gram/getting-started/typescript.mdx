import { Callout } from "@/mdx/components";

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the process of creating tools and a MCP server using Gram Functions.
Gram Functions allows you to deploy completely isolated tool call environments that can then be exposed as MCP servers.

```typescript filename="gram.ts"
import { Gram } from "@gram-ai/functions";
import * as z from "zod/mini";

const gram = new Gram().tool({
  name: "greet",
  description: "Greet someone special",
  inputSchema: { name: z.string() },
  async execute(ctx, input) {
    return ctx.text(`Hello, ${input.name}!`);
  },
});

export default gram;
```

## Step 1: Create a project

Gram offers a bootstrapper through `npm/pnpm create` to create a new project.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  Gram Functions currently requires a node version >=22.18.0
</Callout> 

```bash
npm create @gram-ai/function
```

This will prompt you to pick a framework.
```bash
◆  Pick a framework
│  ● Gram (Default.  A simple framework to get started quickly)
│  ○ MCP (Gram also supports the official MCP SDK for more advanced use cases)
```

This will create a new project in the current directory.
```bash
cd my-mcp-server
```

Inside your project, you'll find the following files:
```bash
└── src
   ├── gram.ts <- Edit me!
   └── server.ts
└── package.json
└── README.md
...
```

## Step 2: Write your tools

Open `src/gram.ts` and write your tools. You can add as many tools as you want, or leave it as-is to use the default tool. For more information on writing tools, see the [Gram Functions](/docs/gram/gram-functions/introduction) documentation.

```typescript filename="src/gram.ts"
import { Gram } from "@gram-ai/functions";
import * as z from "zod/mini";

const gram = new Gram().tool({
  name: "greet",
  description: "Greet someone special",
  inputSchema: { name: z.string() },
  async execute(ctx, input) {
    return ctx.json({ message: `Hello, ${input.name}!` });
  },
});

export default gram;
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  You are not necessarily building an MCP server here. Write whatever tools you want--you will later be able 
  to slice and dice them into MCP servers or combine them with other types of tools into existing MCP servers.
</Callout> 

## Step 3: Build and deploy

To build and deploy your MCP server, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run push
```

This will build your functions and deploy them to Gram. In the [Gram Dashboard](https://app.getgram.ai), you will see the function source you just uploaded and the tools it created.

## Step 4: Create an MCP server

You can now add your tools to an existing MCP server or create a new one.

To create a new MCP server, go to the Toolsets page and click **Create A Toolset** (or **+ Add Toolset**). Name it whatever you want. A toolset is a group of tools that can be exposed as an MCP server.
For more information on toolsets, see the [Toolsets](/docs/gram/build-mcp) documentation.

Now, click **Add Tools** to add your tools to the toolset. You'll see the tools you defined in your `src/gram.ts` file listed here.

Finally, head to the **MCP** tab on the toolset page and click **Enable**. Check out the **Install Page** linked therein for help installing the MCP server in your favorite client. For more information on MCP servers, see the [MCP Servers](/docs/gram/host-mcp) documentation.
