The `auth` command authenticates with the Gram platform by opening a browser
window for login. After successful authentication, it creates and saves a
[Producer API key](/docs/gram/concepts/api-keys#producer-keys) to the local
profile configuration.

<Callout type="info">
    The `gram auth` command is typically run once during initial setup. The
    created API key and profile information are stored in
    `~/.gram/profile.json`.
</Callout>

## Usage

Authenticate with Gram:

```bash
gram auth
```

This command will:

1. Open a browser window to the Gram authentication page
2. Prompt for login credentials
3. Create a Producer API key in the Gram dashboard
4. Saves the API key and profile information locally
5. Saves the current project in the browser as your default project

After authentication, verify the setup with [gram whoami](/docs/gram/command-line/whoami).

## Subcommands

Change your default project context:
```bash
gram auth switch --project {project-slug}
```

Completely clear auth information in your local profile so you can `gram auth` fresh:
```bash
gram auth clear
```


## Options

### <code>api-url</code>

The URL of the Gram web application. This option is useful for connecting to
custom or self-hosted Gram instances.

```bash
gram auth --api-url https://custom.gram.instance [other options]
```

Can also be set via the `GRAM_API_URL` environment variable.
