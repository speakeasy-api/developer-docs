The `stage` command adds sources to a deployment config that you can later pass to Gram
using `gram push`. These sources may include Gram Function zip files or OpenAPI
documents.

The `stage` command is a parent command that contains the following subcommands:

- **[`gram stage function`](/docs/gram/command-line/stage-function):** Stage a
  Gram Function zip file.
- **[`gram stage openapi`](/docs/gram/command-line/stage-openapi):** Stage an
  OpenAPI document.

## Usage

```bash
gram stage [subcommand options]
```

## Options

### <code>config</code>

This specifies the path to the deployment config file. Its default value is `gram.json` in the
current working directory.

```bash
gram stage --config ./path/to/my-gram-config.json [command options]
```
